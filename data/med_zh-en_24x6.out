The transition to parenthood is one of the most stressful adjustment periods new parents face, both with their individual selves and with others.Research into two-way intergenerational relationships during such transitions is very limited, and the complexity of interrelationships varies depending on the context in which they live.The aim of this study is to explore (1) the two-way correlation between marital relationships and conflicts with each other's parents during the transition to parenthood, and (2) the adaptive influence of living with the father on these relationships.The paper studied 359 married mothers using a three-wave prospective long-term study design.Use the Binary Adjustment Scale and Strike Adjustment Checklist Scale to assess marital relationships and conflicting relationships with each other's parents.Interrelationships are studied using cross-lag plane analysis, and multi-group analysis is used to determine whether these relationships exhibit different patterns depending on life situations.Two cross-lag models show a two-way relationship between marital problems and conflict with each other's parents in the middle to late stages of pregnancy.At the same time, the multi-group analysis showed that conflict with each other's parents during pregnancy could lead to marital problems, while conflict with each other's father during late pregnancy and late childbirth could reinforce marital problems in those who did not.These findings reveal intersectional time-lag correlations between generational conflicts.There is a need for health care professionals to ensure that intergenerational relationships are positively beneficial during the transition to parenthood.This research enriches our understanding of the role of living with fathers in marital relationships and can guide the future development of multi-dimensional interventions based on specific cultures.
Linear regression models are widely used in research related to mental health and health services.However, classical linear regression analysis assumes that the data are normally distributed, but the data obtained in many studies do not conform to this assumption.One way to solve this problem is to use semi-parametric models that do not require data to be normally distributed.However, semi-parametric models are quite sensitive to discrete data, so estimates produced when processing data containing discrete values are unreliable.In this case, some researchers analyze these extremes after deleting them, but ad-hoc rules are based on subjective criteria, so different adjustment methods produce different results.Hierarchical regression provides a more objective approach to processing non-normally distributed data including discrete values.This paper uses virtual and real data to illustrate this very useful regression method for dealing with discrete values and compares the results with classical regression models and semi-parametric regression models.
Relationship education (RE) interventions for low-income partners have mixed results.For partners who have experienced positive change, it is not clear which aspects of the project model act as positive agents of change.Many low-income partners participate in publicly funded relationship education, while access to and use of resources such as social and community support is limited.Project models often provide relevant resources to complement specific skills training in relationship education.This paper examines the relationship between income, social support, and family function, as well as the mediating effect of social support on family function outcomes.The study looked at 856 low-income couples who participated in relationship education and came from multiracial backgrounds.The analysis consists of three independent binary models used to study correlations between relevant elements at the baseline, and also includes immediate tracking of the results of relational education interventions.The results of the study showed that the relationship between social support and family function reported by participants showed that: (a) social support was correlated with baseline family function for both men and women; (b) male baseline social support was influenced by baseline family function for women; and (c) male and female social support change scores had a positive impact on their own family function change scores.But social support is not an important regulator of changes in family functioning.How relationship education is implemented and related research is discussed in the Study Inspiration section.
The composition of risk genes in signaling pathways may explain the synergistic neurobiological effects of alcohol dependence risk genes.Identify risk genes and risk gene pathways for alcohol dependence.We performed a pathway-based genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) of alcohol dependence using gene-set-rich analysis.Nearly one million genetic markers were tested in an exploratory sample population that included 1,409 European-American (EA) alcohol addicts and 1,518 EA health controls.In addition, 681 African American (AA) cases and 508 healthy AA subjects were retested.We identified several repeatable genome-wide risk genes and risk pathways that are significantly associated with alcohol dependence.The findings of this study provide new evidence for the "cell-extracellular matrix interaction" pathway (some genetic and biological signaling processes in EA samples may be associated with alcohol dependence risk) after multiple comparisons with Bonferroni correction.
Clinical analysis of 26 patients with acute pulmonary injury caused by diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) using chemotherapy regimen containing rituximab to improve understanding of the disease and guide clinical treatment.From January 2013 to September 2018, 26 DLBCL patients with acute pulmonary injury treated with chemotherapy regimen containing rituximab were selected to analyze their clinical characteristics, imaging performance, chemotherapy regimen, treatment effectiveness and prognosis.The main clinical symptoms of patients are fever, cough and chest tightness; 12 patients with hypoxemia, 3 patients with type I respiratory failure; chest CT is mainly manifested by double lung diffuse grinding glass shadow, some patients combined with a small amount of chest effusion; the onset time is mainly distributed in 2-4 courses of treatment, symptoms appear within 8-49 d from the time of infusion of rituximab in the plan; 25 patients have no obvious limitation of daily life after effective treatment, 1 patient died of ineffective treatmentDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma Early atypical clinical symptoms of acute lung injury following chemotherapy regimens containing rituximab, early detection and early hormone therapy are essential for good therapeutic outcomes.
Explore non-genetically related factors that influence overall survival in patients with multiple myeloma (MM).Retrospective analysis of clinical data of 51 MM patients with complete follow-up data at the Hematology Department of Jiangning Hospital affiliated to Nanjing Medical University from November 2011 to October 2019.Non-genetic influencers are analyzed using total survival time as a prognostic evaluation criterion.The Kaplan-Meier method is used for survival analysis, and the log-rank test is used for single-factor analysis of prognosis-related influencing factors, and the Cox regression model is used for multi-factor analysis.Of the 51 patients, 29 were men and 22 were women, followed up to December 2019, 21 died and 30 survived.The single-factor analysis showed that the total survival time of patients was significantly extended in patients with age 65 years, ISS stages and, standard treatment, use of new drugs, normal or below normal levels of blood calcium, normal or below normal levels of globulin and albumin 35 g / L or hemoglobin 100 g / L (P 0.05).Multi-factor analysis shows that maintenance therapy, calcium 2.6mmol / L and hemoglobin 100g / L are independent risk factors affecting MM prognosis.Poor prognosis in patients with blood calcium 2.6mmol / L and hemoglobin 100g / L without regular maintenance therapy.
Abstract: This article was presented at the 2019 Cambridge Ophthalmology Symposium.HS Dua receives fees and travel expenses from Dompe, Croma, Santen, Allergan and Thea and owns shares in NuVision biotherapies and GlaxoSmithKline.NuVision Biotherapies is the manufacturer of Omnigen mentioned in the article.Chemical eye injury (CEI) is a serious vision and life threatening emergency, usually occurring at home or at work. The former is usually milder and the latter is heavier and involves both eyes.Serious work accident injuries also involve damage to other parts of the body and may be related to inhalation or ingestion of chemicals.Alkali burns cause tissue saponification and penetrate deep into the tissue.Acid damage causes tissue to solidify quickly, preventing penetration and limiting damage.Irritant substances such as alcohol can cause superficial epithelium peeling.Severe chemical damage can affect the entire annular joint structure, resulting in iris, pupils and lens abnormalities.Eye pressure is affected differently and may decrease or increase, or change quickly from one condition to another.Choroid retinopathy is thought to be secondary to eye joint inflammation, not due to direct action of CEI.The final outcome related to structure and function depends on the cause of injury, exposure time, treatment and the speed of intervention.After determining the eye pH, extensive and persistent eye flushing to prevent further damage as well as locating and removing all particulate matter is key.Other treatment principles include comprehensive assessment of the eye area, control of inflammation, promotion of healing and prevention and management of sequelae and complications.Intraocular pressure is often overlooked but must be evaluated and managed.Management often requires multidisciplinary cooperation.
Cell apoptosis is a procedural form of death that relies on cysteine aspartate protease (Caspase-1 / 4 / 5 / 11) and is characterized by inflammatory cell activation, cell membrane rupture, formation of cavities, and release of cell content.Cellular apoptosis is widely involved in respiratory diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, acute pulmonary injury / respiratory distress syndrome, bronchial dysplasia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma as a novel form of cell death.This paper reviews the mechanism of cell scorching and its role in different respiratory diseases with a view to providing new ideas for the treatment of respiratory diseases.
Study and analysis of risk factors for shingles during bortezomib chemotherapy in patients with multiple myeloma (MM).We collected clinical data on 85 MM patients treated with bortezomib-based chemotherapy regimen at Gansu Provincial People's Hospital from January 2015 to January 2019, divided into case groups and control groups based on whether or not shingles occurred.Retrospective analysis of clinical characteristics, treatment and fate and risk factors for shingles.Of the 85 MM patients treated with bortezomib, 20 developed shingles, with an incidence rate of about 23.5.One-factor analysis showed that age 65 years, pre-treatment lymphocytopenia, pre-treatment neutropenia, ECOG score 2, use of cyclophosphamide, absence of preventive antiviral therapy were associated with shingles (P 0.05).Multi-factor logistic regression analysis showed that pre-treatment lymphocytopenia, use of cyclophosphamide, failure to administer preventive antiviral therapy were independent risk factors for shingles (P 0.05).The incidence of shingles in MM patients is high, before treatment of lymphocytopenia, the use of cyclophosphamide, not given preventive antiviral therapy is important risk factors for shingles, clinicians need to pay
Clinical characteristics and prognosis factors of adult patients with Langehans histiocytosis (LCH). Retrospective analysis of clinical characteristics and laboratory characteristics of 38 adult patients with LCH diagnosed with histopathology at our hospital between January 2010 and August 2019. In-depth analysis of clinical prognosis. The median age of 38 patients with LCH was 41 (21-65 years old), with a ratio of 2: 1 men to women.Of the 38 patients with LCH, 44.7 had multisystem involvement, 31.6 had involvement of dangerous organs (liver, lungs, hematopoietic system or spleen), the most common organ involved was bone (21 / 38, 55.3) and the most common clinical symptom was pain (19 / 38, 50.0).Laboratory tests showed that rates of anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, lymphocytopenia, monocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein, elevated blood sedimentation and elevated ferritin were 10.5, 2.6, 5.3, 15.8, 28.9, 28.6 (6 / 21), 55.3 (10 / 18) and 55.3 (9 / 17)The median follow-up time was 53 months and a total of five patients died.The 10-year total survival (OS) rate for single-system patients is 100, significantly better than for multi-system patients (70.1) (P 0.0078).The prognosis of patients with non-hazardous organ involvement was significantly better than that of patients with dangerous organ involvement, with 10-year OS rates of 100 percent and 60.6 percent (P 0.0007), respectivelyFurther analysis found that in addition to multisystem involvement and risk organ involvement as adverse prognostic factors, peripheral blood mononucleosis and ferritin elevation at initial diagnosis were significantly associated with poor prognosis.
The degree of acceptance of a relationship from a person's social network can predict the outcome of such a relationship.Other studies have shown that attachment behavior can cushion the negative effects of various factors (such as depression) on relationships.In this study sample, which included 858 married couples, we used the actor-partner interdependence model within the SEM framework to explore the impact of disagreement from parents and friends on the quality of their relationship with their partner.We also looked at whether each partner's attachment behavior could slow those effects.The results showed that regardless of male or female, one party's own attachment mitigated the effect of parental and friend disagreement on the quality of their self-reported relationship.The attachment behaviour of a partner mitigates the effect of one's own friends disagreeing with the quality of self-reported relationships between men and women; moreover, the main effect of disagreeing with the partner's parents and friends is not significant in the testThe findings support the conclusion that both partners' attachment behavior has a buffer effect, i.e. a role in the negative impact of disagreement from members of social networks on partnership outcomes.The clinical significance was discussed.
Clinical practice guidelines, such as those focusing on traumatic stress treatment, can play an important role in promoting inclusiveness and equity.Based on a review of 14 international trauma treatment guidance documents that explicitly refer to children, we reflect on two areas where these guidelines could be made more inclusive and equitable; a) representation of children's cultural context; and b) opportunities for children to make their voices heard.Although several guidelines mention that treatments should be tailored to the child's cultural needs, there is little guidance on how this can be achieved.Moreover, there still seems to be a strong white Western perspective at all stages of generating and evaluating the international evidence base.The existing guidelines also mean that young people under 18 years of age were not consulted during the development of the guidelines.To promote inclusiveness and equity, we have proposed five elements for future national guidance development.Promoting research and guidance development with and for currently underrepresented groups should be a high priority in our field.Our national, regional and global professional associations are well placed to (continue) promote dialogue and action in this field.
Review of perioperative blood management (PBM) measures for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA).We thoroughly read and summarize the progress of PBM measures on TKA and THA at home and abroad in recent years, combined with the clinical practice experience of West China Hospital of Sichuan University, in-depth evaluation and analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of various measures in terms of optimizing hematopoiesis, reducing blood loss andCurrently used for TKA and THA PBM way more, including optimization of hematopoietic mainly includes the perioperative application of iron and erythropoietin; measures to reduce blood loss include the use of tourniquet, controlled blood pressure reduction during surgery and perioperative application of anti-fibrolytic drugs; autologous blood transfusion mainly includes pre-existing autologous blood transfusion, blood thinning autologous blood transfusion and intraoperative autologous bloodPreoperative application of erythropoietin combined with iron agents for blood mobilization, intraoperative controlled blood pressure reduction to reduce blood loss, combined with the application of multimodal aminocyclic acid can achieve satisfactory resultsTKA and THA perioperative period should be based on the patient's physical and financial situation, individual choice of single or multiple blood management measures to reduce blood loss and allogeneic blood transfusion needs, accelerate patient recovery after surgery
Comparing the clinical effectiveness of Vesselplasty and percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) in the treatment of Kmmell disease.From January 2015 to December 2018, 63 patients with Kmmell disease were treated, of which 28 were treated with Vesselplasty (Vesselplasty group) and 35 with PKP (PKP group).Compared with general data such as gender, age, course of disease, bone density T value, fracture segment and preoperative pain visual simulation score (VAS), Oswestry dysfunction index (ODI), injury leading edge height, kyphosis Cobb angle, the difference was not statistically significant (both groups were followed up for 12-36 months with an average of 24.2 months).Vesselplasty group surgery time, intraoperative perspective time, bone cement injection volume, bone cement dispersion area rate is significantly lower than PKP group (Vesselplasty and PKP treatment of Kmmell disease similar effect, can effectively relieve patients pain symptoms, improve quality of life, partially restore the height of the injured vertebrae, correct the kyphosis of the vertebraeBut the former has the advantages of short surgical time, less intraoperative perspective time, less bone cement leakage and so on.
This systematic overview examines the impact of post-migration variables on the mental health of asylum-seekers and refugees in Europe.It focuses on the impact of post-migration stressors (including length and duration of asylum process, residence status and social integration) and their impact on post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression.This study summarizes 22 studies.In 9 out of 22 studies, the length and duration of the asylum process were found to be the most commonly cited mental health difficulties.Seven studies reported significant correlations between risk factors and mental health, and were modulated by residential status.Conversely, the effects of legal status are more complexly linked to other post-immigration factors.It has been found to be a sign of other post-migration variables including loneliness, discrimination, communication or language problems.Family-related difficulties were also found to be related to length of stay and legal status, while other post-migration variables such as residence and length of stay were found to have a greater impact on mental
The discovery of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) provides the scientific basis for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB).The prevalence of neonatal hepatitis B vaccine greatly reduces the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in our population. Antiviral therapy based on interferon and / or nucleoside (acid) analogues can effectively inhibit HBV replication, improve liver inflammatory necrosis and liver fibrosis, thereby reducing the incidence of cirrhosis and hepatocHowever, existing treatments are difficult to achieve the clinical goal of HBsAg trans-negative treatment.In recent years, direct antiviral drugs targeting the life cycle of HBV and immunomodulatory drugs targeting the body's antiviral response have entered the active phase of developmentWell-designed, well-executed, correctly analyzed and properly interpreted clinical trials are key to the success of the development of new drugs for hepatitis B clinical treatment.We hope that experts in hepatology, clinical pharmacology and methodology will work together to promote the development of new drugs for the clinical cure of hepatitis B by adopting new clinical trial design, new endpoint indicators, new data management and quality control technologies.
Compare the efficacy of perforated tunnel suture fixation and anchor fixation in repairing lateral collateral ligament complex (LCLC) damage in elbow terror triple.Review and analyze the clinical data of 50 patients admitted from June 2012 to January 2018, including 22 with anchor fixation (anchor fixation group) and 28 with bone-tunnel suture fixation (bone-tunneling group) to repair LCLC.The difference between the two groups of patients is not statistically significant when comparing general data such as sex, age, fracture side, injury to hospital admission time and coronary protrusion fracture, hip fracture and elbow terror triplotype.
The clinical data of 72 patients admitted to the Hematology Department of the Affiliated Hospital of Southeast University from December 2012 to December 2018 were retrospectively analyzed and the remission rate of patients treated with rituximab combined with CHOP / EPOCH was analyzed.At the same time, survival analysis was conducted to explore the high risk factors affecting difficult-to-treat relapse. Of the 72 patients, 45 received CR and 11 received PR, with a total remission rate of 77.78 percent, including 25 patients with difficult-to-treat relapseSingle-factor analysis showed that B-symptoms, low Hb levels, high NLR, low LMR, high rituximab combined with CHOP / EPOCH regimen DLBCL remission rate is higher, but still about 1 / 3 of patients difficult to treat recurrence.B symptoms, low Hb, high acne
A review of common surgical methods used for hip arthroscopic treatment of sinus-lip injuries is provided as a reference for clinical treatment.Review recent domestic and international literature on surgical methods and clinical results of hip arthroscopic treatment of lip injury.In the early days of hip arthroscopy, cleaning up a torn labial lip was the main treatment option.The current treatment principle is based on the degree of lip tear surgery, including lip clean-up, lip repair, lip reconstruction and lip reinforcement.Hip arthroscopic surgery has become the dominant technique for treating lip injuries. Lip prosthetics should be preferred where possible, or lip reconstruction if not possible.
A systematic approach to studying family and health should capture complex networks where family members are intertwined, including multiple family relationships and larger health systems.However, many family and health-related studies that focus on adult family members focus only on intimate relationships, i.e. marital relationships.Many other powerful family relationships maintained by adults are neglected, and as they get older, they tend to pay more attention to intimacy.This paper conducts a systematic study of literature related to family and adult health, with 72 selected articles decoded by theme to identify the main core topics in the field.The results showed six broad themes, including: quality of family relationships, family structure, health and health-related behavioural factors, psycho-physical conditioning factors, caregiving, and elderly health.The findings support family members who are less represented in adult health studies than just intimate partners.
Chronic intake of high levels of ethanol leads to enterogenic endotoxemia, where reactive oxygen, high concentrations of adenosine triphosphate and uric acid activate the scorched apoptosis system, leading to hepatocyte death by cutting Gasdermin-D perforation mechanisms, accompanied by release of inflammatory factors such as interleukin-1 and interleukinThis series of processes activates the immune system, mediates cascading inflammatory responses and promotes the progression of alcoholic liver disease from fat degeneration to inflammation, fibrosis.
Conflict at the family level and family cohesion are recognized indicators of adolescent mental health.However, traditional research methods, which focus on differences in cohesion and conflict between families and families, often overlook everyday variability within a particular household, which may provide important new information.This study included 151 caregivers (95.3 female) from households with two caregivers and their adolescent children (61.5 female). We used data from their daily records lasting 21 days to test whether daily changes in family function correlated with daily changes in adolescent happiness and whether adolescent happiness depended on average family functioning.We used a multilevel model to study family cohesion and family conflict, their correlation with adolescent anger, depression and anxiety, as well as happiness, life satisfaction, and meaning and purpose in life.The study concluded that meaningful changes were shown on a daily basis in terms of cohesion and conflict.Adolescents report particular intra-family associations between cohesion and conflict and six adolescent outcomes.Models using data on family functioning reported by parents produce fewer correlations than models using data reported by adolescents.There are several more findings from this study.Cross-level interactions suggest that differences in cohesion within families are only associated with adolescent depression in families living below the average level of family cohesion.Overall, the study provides compelling evidence that family life shows meaningful differences every day, and that daily differences can have a significant impact on teens' happiness.
Study the clinical efficacy and prognostic factors of newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients aged 10-18 years to provide a basis for clinical treatment options.Retrospective analysis of clinical data of 119 newly diagnosed ALL patients aged 10-18 admitted to Jinan Second Maternal and Child Health Hospital from January 2008 to December 2015, including baseline clinical characteristics, induced therapy remission effect, long-term efficacy, relapse and death, and single-factor and multi-factor evaluation of clinical prognostic factors.There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients treated with ALL-2005 versus ALL-2009 who achieved complete remission at week 5 after induction therapy (P 0.05).The cumulative event-free survival and overall survival rates for 119 patients were (63.41 3.65) and (68.95 4.01), respectively, and (61.86 3.72) and (67.22 3.59) for seven years.There was no significant difference between the cumulative and total survival rate, total recurrence rate, extra-medullary recurrence rate, recurrence time, and survival rates in follow-up patients treated with ALL-2005 and ALL-2009 (P 0.05); survival rates were significantly higher in the extra-medullary recurrence group than in the bone marrow recurrence group (P 0.05); survival rates were significantly higher in the late recurrence group than in the early recurrence group (Single-factor analysis showed that age, gender, effect of induction therapy, risk and fusion genes were factors influencing patient's clinical prognosis (P 0.05), while Cox regression model multi-factor analysis showed that men, unmitigated induction therapy and high risk were independent risk factors for poor patient prognosis (P 0.05).Combined BCR-ABL 10-18 years old Newly diagnosed ALL patients with ALL-2009 regimen have slightly improved survival rate compared with ALL-2005 regimen, more suitable for combined BCR-ABL
The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that there is a long-term relationship between parental development of children's coping abilities (SOC) and children's emotional regulation.The sample was taken from 256 parents with children between 5 and 12 years of age (average age of children 8.36, SD 2.03, 54.7 of men; average age of parents 34.49, SD 6.20, 59Participants were asked to complete online questionnaires at the beginning and 12 months in order to gather data on demographics, parenting behavior, and children's emotional regulation abilities.The results of the longitudinal Structural Equation Model (SEM) analysis showed that parent SOCs measured at baseline predicted maladaptation and maladaptation in emotional regulation measured after 12 months.More specifically, parental advice on coping strategies for actively developing children predicts adaptability in emotional regulation, while parental lack of development of coping skills predicts maladaptability in emotional regulation.In addition, the child's gender plays a role in regulating the longitudinal association between parents actively developing coping strategies and children's emotional adaptation: although small, the association is relatively small for girls and larger for boys, and statistically significant.The results of this study emphasize the importance of parental SOC as it has the potential to improve emotional regulation in children between 5 and 12 years of age.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type-IIb (MEN-IIb) is a rare autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the RET gene. It has special clinical phenotypes such as mucosal neuromas, Macrioid syndrome type, thyroid myeloid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma.Clinicians are poorly aware of the disease and diagnosis is often delayed.In November 2018, Xiangya Three Hospital of Central South University treated a patient with MEN-IIb. The patient had lingual mucosal neuroma since childhood. He had undergone surgery for mitral valve prolapse and spinal malformation. He was diagnosed with thyroid medullary cancer at age 22 and underwent surgery.Genetic testing indicates that the patient carries a new RET gene p. M918T hybrid mutation.Early identification of clinical manifestations outside the endocrine system and screening for RET genes are key to early diagnosis and treatment.
Phenotype and genotype analysis of hereditary clotting factor (F) deficiency families caused by complex hybrid mutations. Phenotype and gene mutation analysis of hereditary clotting factor (F) deficiency families by detecting complex hybrid mutations and exploring its molecular pathogenesis. Detection of precursors and family members (3 generations 10 people) Plasma Thrombogen Time (PT), Activated Partial Thrombotic Activase Time (APTT), Fibrinogen (FIB), F Coagulant Activity (F: C), F Antigen (F: Ag) and other relevant clotting indicators for clear diagnosis.Direct DNA sequencing was used to analyze all exons, flanks, 5 and 3 non-translated regions of the F5 gene and corresponding mutation sites of family members, and found mutation sites confirmed by reverse sequencing.ClustalX-2.1-win software analyzes mutant amino acid conservation, PROVEAN and MutationTaster online bioinformatics software predict mutation effect on protein function, Swiss-PdbViewer software performs protein model and amino acid interaction analysis at mutation site. The precursors PT and APTT are significantly longer than normal control health checkups, 34.2 vs 13.2 s and 119.3 vs 36.0 s respectively; F: C and F: Ag are extremely lower, 3 and 6 respectively.The second child, third child, daughter and grandchild of the precursor had slightly longer PT and APTT, F: C and F: Ag decreased to varying degrees, and the relevant coagulation parameters of other family members were within the normal range.There is a c.911G > A hybrid delusion mutation on exon 6 of Precursor, resulting in p. Gly276Glu, and a c.5343C > G hybrid delusion mutation on exon 16, resulting in p. Ser1781Arg.His second son, third son and grandchild all carry p.Gly276Glu hybrids, his daughter carries p.Ser1781Arg hybrids, and other family members are wild-type.The conservative analysis showed that Gly276 and Ser1781 were highly conservative among homologous species.The two bioinformatics software predictions were the same, with PROVEAN (scores -6.214 and -12.79) suggesting that the composite hybrid mutation was a harmful mutation; MutationTaster (scores 0.976 and 0.999) suggesting that these mutations could cause corresponding diseases.p.Gly276Glu protein model analysis shows that the Glu side chain is extended and the molecular weight becomes larger, which will increase the spatial barrier between it and the surrounding amino acids, affect the normal local folding of the F protein, and ultimately lead to decreased protein activity and content.The spatial structure analysis of p.Ser1781Arg mutant protein cannot be performed because there is no X-ray 3D structure file of exon 16 F. The new complex hybrid mutations identified in this study (p.Gly276Glu and p.Ser1781Arg) are the main causes of the decline in F levels in this family, among which p.Ser1781Arg is rarely reported at home and abroad.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major public health problem worldwide.Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly contagious and attacks primarily the lungs, causing respiratory distress syndrome and even multi-organ failure.The kidneys are also one of the main organs attacked by the virus, which directly damages the renal tubules through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and causes cytokine storms leading to kidney damage, increasing theEarly detection of COVID-19 patients with kidney damage risk factors, detection of kidney damage indicators, timely support treatment and renal replacement therapy for patients with kidney damage, can reduce the mortality rate.
A 2100 bioanalyzer combined with protein chips was used to obtain protein expression profiles of post-mortem rat liver tissue and estimate its relationship with time of death.Method After death from abdominal anesthesia, rats were placed in a 16 environment to extract water-soluble proteins from liver tissue at 14 time points after death. Protein chips were used to obtain protein expression spectrum data with relative molecular masses of 14,000-230,000. The data were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and Fisher discrimination.The time of death was divided into groups A (0 d), B (1-9 d), and C (12-30 d) based on changes in protein expression spectrum and PLS-DA results.As determined by Fisher, the prediction accuracy of both the training and test sets of the model is 100.0, and the internal cross-validation accuracy of the training set is 100.0.By building Fisher discriminant models for each time point in Group B and Group C, the prediction accuracy of the training set and test set in Group B was 100.0, and the internal cross-validation accuracy of the training set was 100.0; the prediction accuracy of the training set and test set in Group C was 95.2 and 78.6, respectively, and the internal cross-validation accuracy of the training setConclusion Protein chip detection technology can quickly and easily obtain water-soluble protein expression profiles of liver tissue with relative molecular mass between 14,000 and 230,000 at different points in time after death in rats, and establish PLS-DA and Fisher discriminant models to determine the time of death by classification, which is expected to provide new ideas and methods for time of death inference
Primary health care provides a cost-effective way to achieve universal health coverage (UHC).In many low- and middle-income countries, however, primary health care systems are very weak and often fail to provide comprehensive, people-centred integrated health care.Using semi-rooted research methods, we analyzed primary health care systems in 20 low- and middle-income countries.The analysis of thematic elements identified options for strengthening the primary health-care system.We found that: (i) despite the growing burden of NCDs, many low- and middle-income countries still lack funding for prevention services; (ii) community health workers are often under-resourced, poorly supported and lack appropriate training; (iii) out-of-pocket spending on health exceeds 40 per cent of total health spending in half of the countries studied, which is detrimental to equity; and (iv) fragmented public and private systems, underfunding, corruption and inadequate participation of informal workers hamper health insurance schemes.In 14 countries, the private sector is largely unregulated.Moreover, in countries where services are largely privatized, there is little community participation in primary health care.Decentralization in some countries has contributed to the decentralization of primary health care.Performance improves when financial incentives are combined with regulatory and quality improvements, and community participation increases.Adequate resources should be provided for decision-making in primary health care and government spending on primary health care should be increased by at least 1 per cent of GDP.Equitable financing programmes are also needed to enhance accountability in primary health-care management.Support from the primary health care system is critical to achieving UHC in the decade ending 2030.
Lee-Fermeni syndrome is an inherited disease that has a roughly 90 percent chance of developing cancer over a lifetime and requires family members to undergo comprehensive cancer screening throughout their lives.This paper examines the role of health care in managing the risk and treatment of Li-Fermeni syndrome, which is borne by parents, adolescents and adult children.Twenty-three families participated in the study using semi-structured interviews.Families consist of two to five family members, with younger generations in each family ranging in age from 7 to 40 years.Using a grassroots theoretical approach, we conducted open and centralized decoding of interview transcripts.Family members described how the role of health leader was realized within the family, along with factors such as the maturity of children and the death of a family member, which determined who assumed what roles and how those roles changed over time.They often express collective shared responsibility to help relatives understand LFS and implement appropriate cancer risk management.Family members achieve their health role by accompanying them to a doctor for support and information gathering.The role of health leaders is intergenerational, providing necessary support to families, especially in complex healthcare decisions.Our findings provide insights into health care providers, primarily about how LFS patients and their relatives make specific medical decisions and play caregiver roles, which are heavily influenced by LFS genetic properties, and how these roles change over time.Those providers who can adapt to the dynamics of family roles can better meet the psychosocial and medical needs of relatives, primarily by trying to understand the functioning of family systems affected by LFS and by promoting mutual support among family members.
Corneal keratopigmentation (KTP) has a long history of treating patients with corneal opacity.Due to the updating and improvement of KTP surgical techniques and its low incidence of complications, it is often considered for therapeutic or functional indications.This paper describes the clinical application of KTP in cosmetic and functional aspects and discusses the surgical effects of KTP and its characteristics in experimental and histopathological studies.
Vascular surgery to discuss the need for vascular conditions and vascular reconstruction in the treatment of chronic ischemic disease of lower limbs by transversal bone transfer technology.Review and analyze clinical data of 59 patients with chronic ischemic disease of lower extremities treated with transversal bone transfer technique from February 2014 to July 2019.Among them, 41 patients with diabetic foot (DF), Wagner 3-4, Texas 2-3, B-D lesions; course 0.7-2.4 years, average 1.5 years; combined with lower limb arteriosclerosis obliteran (ASO) 5 cases.14 ASO patients, course 1.5-23.4 months, average 10.8 months; Fontaine, Rutherford.Lower limb thromboangiitis obliteran (TAO) 4 patients, course 2.1-18.2 months, average 12.3 months; clinical stages are three stages.Among them, 18 cases of pre- and post-surgical ankle brachial index (ABI) 0.6, or imaging examination of the knee anterior artery without three branches reaching the ankle, vascular reconstruction opened the upper blood vessels (DF combined ASO 5 cases, ASO 12 cases, TAO 1 case).After surgery, the effectiveness of treatment is evaluated by ulcer wound healing, skin temperature, pain visual simulation score (VAS), ABI, CT angiography (CTA) examination, etc.DF patients were followed for 8-16 months with an average of 12.2 months; ulcer wounds were healed with a healing time of 5.1-9.2 weeks with an average of 6.8 weeks; 5 routine vascular reconstructors observed vascular reconnection of the anterior sacral artery branch of the knee after CTA surgery; tibia osteotomy both healed with a healing time of 5ASO patients were followed up for 13-25 months with an average of 16.8 months; ulcer wound healing time was 6.2-9.7 weeks with an average of 7.4 weeks; 12 cases of vascular reconstruction showed anterior knee artery branch recommunication; tibia osteotomy both healed with a healing time of 4.5-14.4 weeks with an average of 10.2 weeks.Patients with TAO were followed up for 12-23 months, averaging 12.3 months; treatment was ineffective and eventually amputated toes / limbs.ABI, VAS score, and skin temperature in the combined vascular reconstruction group improved significantly over 6 months after surgery (ABI 0.6 in the anterior and / or posterior cranial arteries). Imaging showed that at least one of the three branches of the anterior cranial artery in the knee reaches the ankle.DF is an adaptation of transversal humerus bone transfer technology, ASO can choose transversal humerus bone transfer technology, TAO carefully use this technology.
In the study of patients with acute early granulocytic leukemia (APL), the characteristics of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the breath composition of patients with APL were studied and the feasibility of VOC for APL diagnosis and efficacy evaluation was discussed. Using SPME-GC / MS technology to detect VOC in exhaled gas; comparing VOC in APL initial diagnosis group, relapse group, remission group and healthy group; comparing VOC in APL initial diagnosis group, Kruskal-Wallis variance analysis and Dunn-Bonferroni test.Dimethyl sulfide, toluene and dodecane decreased significantly in the mitigation group compared to the initial group, ethanol, n-hexane and benzaldehyde increased significantly (P 0.05), while VOC in the relapsed group was the opposite from the remission group. Dimethyl sulfide, toluene, dodecane, ethanol, benzaldehyde and n-hexane were
Mental health problems occur, develop, and manage over a relatively long period of time, so a significant portion of psychiatric research - particularly those that answer clearly about the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors - requires multiple assessments of patients and their living environment over time and over time.However, many researchers in psychiatry use incorrect statistical methods to analyze this type of longitudinal data, a problem that can lead to unrecognizable biases in analysis results that lead to incorrect conclusions.This article introduces the topic of longitudinal data analysis.The paper explores the different dataset structures used in longitudinal data analysis, the classification and processing of missing data, and methods of in-person correlation correction when building multivariate regression models using longitud

Low-income partners have a much higher rate of relationship breakdowns than high-income partners, including divorce and breakup from cohabiting partners.Recognizing that relational interventions can make a difference in relationship development outcomes, interventions are increasingly targeted at such populations.However, the impact of these interventions on relationships with low-income partners has been very limited.For relationship interventions for low-income partners to be effective and responsive to their needs, they need to describe data that reflect how the partners themselves perceive problems in their relationships and how they assess their own needs compared to representative interventions used by high-income partners.A sample of 5,000 individuals recruited online for relationship intervention also compared the relationship status and living conditions of both low-income and higher-income partners.The results showed that when low-income partners sought relationship intervention, the relationship experienced higher levels of distress (lower relationship satisfaction, more major relationship problems, less relationship stability) and higher levels of stress in overall life situations (more children living at home, less likely to have full-time employment, poor health).The results suggest that interventions designed for future development should focus on the needs of low-income partners, and that physicians who treat low-income partners should be prepared to deal with higher levels of relationship stress and multiple factors that contribute to their stressful environment, which are not common in more affluent partners on a daily basis.
With the development of industry, musculoskeletal diseases have become increasingly problematic, with lower back pain being one of the main problems, and the United States and Germany have included it in theTherefore, it is important to determine the occupational factors that affect lower back pain and assess the load level of workers.This paper provides a review of the evaluation methods of low back pain load in conjunction with existing literature to inform the development of prevention strategies for low back pain at the occupational level.
Studies have linked men's adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and trauma symptoms to their IPV criminal behaviour (intimate partner violence) and abuse experiences, but several important aspects that act as barriers to violence interventions have not been thoroughly studied.Specifically, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) dominates the range of trauma symptoms studied in the field, limiting researchers' understanding of other manifestations of trauma, particularly in men.In addition, most studies focus only on men's physical aspects of IPV criminal behavior, with little focus on areas of research such as other types of IPV behavior, severity of violence or male persecution.Also, few studies have focused on possible protective factors based on the ACE framework, such as cognitive behavior in clinical populations.Finally, most study participants have yet to focus on people of color, although some racial / ethnic minority groups have relatively high rates of exposure to IPV.For these reasons, this study investigates the correlation between frequency and severity of IPV (psychological, physical, injury) and ACES, PTSD, trauma symptomology (as distinct from PTSD), and conscious self-efficacy.The sample was drawn from 67 men of color, most of whom were low income and were participating in a wife abuse intervention program.More than half of the samples (51.5 percent) reported having experienced four or more ACEs, and 31.1 percent of those studied met diagnostic criteria for patients with suspected PTSD.Higher ACE scores predict higher self-reported IPV crime rates and higher victimization rates for almost all types.The severity of PTSD symptoms and complex trauma symptoms combined explain 13 to 40 percent of IPV outcomes, and each result is uniquely associated with the frequency and severity of certain types of self-reported IPV victimization and violence.Awareness of self-efficacy is associated with a decrease in criminal behaviour and victimization experiences and a decrease in the frequency and severity of self-reported psychological aspects of IPV.This study provides an overview of relevant clinical interventions targeting non-mainstream marginalized groups of men, including screening, training and possible therapeutic interventions.
Strong ties between family members have an important impact on the well-being of adolescents and contribute to their physical, psychological and social well-being.However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of these roles.The present study is a long-term study that examined the process of strong bonds between family members that teens knew, which predicted that teens would have more positive health behaviors and fewer negative health behaviors over time.In particular, we sought to find out whether adaptive and poorly adapted coping strategies reconcile family closeness with self-reported adolescent health.The study used data from 1,774 New Zealand teenagers aged 10 to 17 who completed three self-report questionnaires a year.Using a longitudinal mediation pathway model, we tested whether maladaptive and adaptive coping strategies in T2 reconcile family tightness in T1 with overall health, vitality, adequate sleep, body satisfaction, substance use and self-harm in T3.The results showed that close family ties predicted high levels of adaptive coping ability, which predicted improved health indicators but no decline in disease indicators.In addition, strong ties between family members predict fewer maladaptations in the face of stress setbacks, which in turn predict higher levels of positive health outcomes and fewer adverse health outcomes.The results of this study suggest that close family ties have a positive impact on adolescent health through increased use of adaptive coping strategies, reduced use of poor adaptation strategies when dealing with stress setbacks, or both.These results are important for clinical therapists working with adolescents and parents and those involved in developing health promotion programs.
Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 12 percent of the world's population, with 4.3 million people blind and more than 15 million visually impaired.But SSA has only 2.5 ophthalmologists per million people.So training eye doctors in the region is crucial.We designed a systematic literature review scheme, MEDLINE, Ovid and Embase OVID, and searched literature published between August 1, 2019 and 2000 onwards.We also searched the websites of Google Scholar and other eye facilities for more information.This paper includes 49 references and analyzes the results in a narrative manner.There are 56 training institutions for ophthalmologists in 11 English-speaking countries, 11 French-speaking countries and 2 Portuguese-speaking SSA countries.The median length of an eye training course is 4 years.Most courses are regionally standardized.National, provincial and international cooperation is a key feature of eye training in more than half of all eye training programs.Although it may not always be evidence-based, professional refinement is being driven in the region.There is little published scientific data available for ophthalmic medical and surgical training in the SSA region, especially in French-speaking and Portuguese-speaking countries.However, through extensive review strategies, it is possible to obtain a valuable and detailed overview of SSA eye training.The training of ophthalmologists is a complex and multifaceted task.Existing training institutions face challenges in terms of suitable options, capacity and funding.Many learning outcomes require curriculum, time, faculty, support and proper assessment.Modern training methods offer many opportunities.Collaboration is key.
Osteosarcoma is the most common bone malignancy.Chemotherapy drugs have been used in humans since the 1970s to treat osteosarcoma.However, multi-drug resistance, one of the main adverse effects affecting the efficacy of chemotherapy drugs, reduces survival rates in patients with osteosarcoma to varying degrees.The Notch signaling pathway plays an important role in the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells and affects tumor resistance by reducing intracellular drug accumulation, regulating epithelial-stromal transformation, causing microRNA disorders and expression disorders of apoptotic genes, and regulating tumor stem cells.
Study the level of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in bone marrow in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and its relationship with osteolytic lesions of myeloma, and explore the clinical significance of CTGF in multiple myeloma bone disease.From March 2019 to April 2020, 54 MM patients were selected, and 28 healthy volunteers were selected as a control group. After collecting the bone marrow, CTGF expression in bone marrow supravaginal cleansing was detected by ELISA. The CTGF level of MM patients was significantly higher than the healthy control group (P 0.001); the CTGF level of male patients was significantly higher than that of female patients (P 0.007); the CTGF level of MM patients with osteopathy was significantly higher than that of patients with osteopathy and the control group (P 0.007, P 0.001).CTGF levels in MM patients were positively correlated with the number of bone lesions (r 0.52), while CTGF levels in bone marrow were significantly higher in 3 bone lesions and those without bone lesions (P 0.014, P 0.002).The results of the ROC curve indicate that CTGF expression levels are of significant value for the diagnosis of MM osteopathy (P 0.001).The abnormally high expression of CTGF in MM patients is correlated with the degree of osteolytic lesions in myeloma and can reflect the progression of MM disease
Concentrations of airborne pollutants and germs directly affect human health.Under the same pollution source, effective ventilation determines the quality of air.Therefore, establishing quantitative indicators for effective ventilation and using these indicators to evaluate air quality in specific areas in real time has become an urgent issue to guide residents in choosing healthy outdoor places.Using the Renault Average Navier-Stokes (RANS) method, this study established a simulation system of urban air pollution based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technology.Based on this, real-time meteorological data were used to simulate wind fields and evaluate air quality at different times in urban square space.The results show that the critical wind speed value for effective diffusion of pollutants in the air at pedestrian height (1.5m) is 1.0m s
In order to achieve the World Health Organization goal of "eliminating viral hepatitis as a major public health threat by 2030," the field of research and development of drugs for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) treatment has been developing rapidly in recent years.Early clinical trials (including first human trials) focus on subject selection, study design, choice of dosage and mode of administration, dose climb, monitoring, observation and reporting procedures for adverse events / reactions (tolerance evaluation), and criteria for subjects to continue and discontinue administration.Quantitative pharmacological knowledge is needed to analyze the relationship between in vivo exposure and efficacy and adverse reactions, and to include exploratory indicators: hepatitis B virus (HBV) RNA, HBV core-associated antigen (HBcrAg), etc., to analyze the mechanism of action and target of new drugs and the efficacy of HBV covalent closed loop DNA in anti-hepatocytes.Phase II-III clinical trials focus more on optimal dosage, efficacy, and safety indicators to verify the efficacy and safety of new drugs in a larger population of selected doses.Based on domestic and foreign relevant literature, and combined with the author's practical experience in early clinical research, brief introduction of clinical issues that should be concerned about clinical trial design of CHB
One in five children in Uganda has mental health problems of one kind or another, including disruptive behavioural disorders (DBDs).DBDs can last into adulthood with many adverse consequences.In highly deprived communities in developed countries, effective interventions targeting DBDs have been developed and tested.But interventions remain rare in most African countries like Uganda.The paper describes an adaptation process for how evidence-based interventions originating in the United States can optimize and maintain their original effectiveness in the Ugandan context.As part of a randomized test, the paper looked at teenagers who showed behavioural problems and their caregivers in 30 schools in Uganda.The research process involved the following: initial organization of a gathering of principals and teachers to present the content of the study and the main concepts of the intervention; organization of a Ugandan team to conduct holistic learning on 4Rs and 2Ss-related content during the initial phase; active involvement of community stakeholders and additional feedback on the content and cultural relevance of the intervention; final revision of the instruction manual; collection of children's drawings for use in editing the manual.This paper describes the similarities and differences between the original interventions and the adapted intervention programmes in terms of content and implementation methods.The findings also highlight the importance of involving community stakeholders in the adaptation process.

Direct antiviral drugs (DAAs) are an important means of treating chronic hepatitis B.DAAs can directly interfere with viral infection replication processes, reduce the yield of progenitor viruses, and then affect the two dynamic equilibrium of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the body, namely, the balance between viral replication-circulation viral attenuation in liver cells and the balance between covalent closed ring DNA (cccDNA) pool supplement-cccDNA attenuationExisting nucleoside (acid) analogues are sufficient to affect the first equilibrium, but difficult to shake the second.Therefore, it is necessary to develop new types of DAAs that target different aspects of replication of HBV infection.The two aspects of the balance of cccDNA pool supplementation -cccDNA attenuation are discussed.
Study the role of STAT3 in drug-resistant leukemia cell apoptosis and immune escape, and explore possible mechanisms for leukemia recurrence caused by small residual diseases of leukemia.Transfection of K562 cells with pcDNA3.1-STAT3 plasmid to establish drug-resistant leukemia cell line K562 / STAT3 cells.RQ-PCR and / or Western blot detect expression of STAT3, BAX and NKG2D ligands in control cell lines K562 / - cells and K562 / STAT3 cells for airborne plasmid transfection.Flow cytometry detects apoptosis of K562 / - cells and K562 / STAT3 cells and the lethal effect of NK cells on K562 / - cells and K562 / STAT3 cells.Both total STAT3 and STAT3 phosphorylation levels were significantly increased in K562 / STAT3 cells and the expression of the drug-resistant protein P-gp mRNA was significantly increased (P 0.005).Compared with K562 / -cells, expression levels of the apoptotic gene BAX mRNA of K562 / STAT3 decreased significantly (P 0.005), and apoptosis levels of K562 / STAT3 cells decreased significantly (P 0.002) caused by polysilicon stars. After treatment of K562 / STAT3 cells with STAT3 inhibitors (SH-4-54), expression levels of apoptosis gene BAX mRNA increased significantly (P 0.017) and apoptosis increased significantly (P 0.005).Compared to K562 / -cells, expression levels of NKG2D ligand (MICA and ULBP1) mRNA in K562 / STAT3 cells decreased significantly (P 0.0001), and expression levels of MICA and ULBP1 proteins decreased significantly (MICA: P 0.001, ULBP1: P 0.022). After treatment of K562 / STAT3 cells with STAT3 inhibitors (SH-4-54), MICA mRNA and protein expression levels increased (mRNA: P 0.001, protein: P 0.002), but ULBP1 mRNA and protein did not change significantly (mRNA: P 0.137, protein: P 0.1905).K562 / STAT3 cells are less capable of killing than K562 / -cells (P 0.002), but STAT3 inhibitors restore K562 / STAT3 cell kill sensitivity to NK cells (P 0.006). STAT3 phosphorylation mediates anti-apoptosis of resistant leukemia cells, reducing their kill sensitivity to NK cells.STAT3 inhibitors promote apoptosis of drug-resistant leukemia cells and increase their kill sensitivity to NK cells.
This study aims to elucidate the mechanisms by which parental attachment affects adolescent post-traumatic growth (PTG).Nine and a half years after the Wenchuan earthquake, 872 Chinese teenagers were assessed using a self-report questionnaire.The results showed that parental attachment was directly associated with PTG, with two significant one-step indirect associations (through fair belief and cognitive reassessment) associated with PTG, two significant second-order indirect associations (through fair belief to sense of security and through cognition to fair belief) and a significant third-order indirect association (through feeling safe to feel fair belief to cognitive reassessment).The results showed that feelings of security, impartial beliefs, and cognitive re-evaluation mediated the association between parental attachment and PTG.The findings highlight the importance of family perspective, and clinical psychologists can promote PTGs in teens by helping them build positive parental attachment.
