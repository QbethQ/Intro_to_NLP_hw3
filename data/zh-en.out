Xinhua News Agency Chengdu, July 26: Make outstanding returning migrant workers into a rural revitalization force
Zhang Xiong, 34, returned to his hometown in 2010 after quitting his job in Beijing with a monthly salary of tens of thousands.
After a few years of struggle, he now runs a wine-growing family farm with an annual income of more than $1 million, becoming a well-known leader in wealth, and is selected to enter the village's "two committees."
In recent years, under the inspiration of a series of agricultural and welfare policies such as national poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, more and more outstanding rural workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return to their villages and start businesses, activating a rural spring.
In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries and 61,000 village reserve members have been raised from among the outstanding rural workers, and 20,000 development party members have been nurtured.
He is not happy, but looks at the old town.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young people in rural China have gone out to work to increase their income, some of them starting their own enterprises through struggle
However, it has also led to the emergence of various levels of "hollowization" in the countryside, especially the weakening of the rural grassroots organization. The secretary of the village party branch and the party members display the characteristics of "old age and low education," namely, age, low education, and the leadership of the village party organization is not strong, and the problem
If the village talent and other factors have been going one way to the city, the village is in a state of "blood loss" and "anemia" for a long time,
To attract back migrant workers who have the ability, awareness and desire to serve their hometowns, guide them to return to their hometowns and start their own businesses to become rich leaders. From there, they will be trained to become party members, rural cadres and grassroots cadres. This is a solution to the root causes of rural party members and grassroots party organizations.
The good migrant workers are brought back, and they must stay and do well.
In recent years, Sichuan has started from the construction of the Peasant Workers Party to establish institutional mechanisms such as orientation introduction, service guarantee, training, and selection and use of outstanding rural workers on the basis of strict selection criteria, so that they can enhance their ability, work security and life skills, take root in the countryside and have a real sense of achievement among officers.
This year is the end of the battle to fight poverty, to do a good job of fighting poverty and rural revitalization, talent is the key factor.
The Party committee and government at all levels should attach great importance to the group of good returning rural migrant workers, and adopt comprehensive measures to make them a retention, combatable, non-removable task force and force, so as to provide strong organizational security and talent support for rural poverty alleviation and development and revitalization.
Because of the epidemic, this year's college graduates are a very special one. On the evening of July 11, the bilibili summer graduation song will bring a special online live performance for graduates. Musicians such as old wolves, Park Shu, Li Yuchun and Mao are not easy to send songs and blessings to new graduates
The famous upstart, Sealwu Wu, also brought a song called "Weeds," a rap song he wrote based on Lu Xun's prose collection of the same name, which is extremely popular among young people.
As a result of the epidemic, many graduates fail to appreciate the ritual sense of on-site dispensing and degree-granting, and they move the ritual sense online.
According to the data, the 2.5-hour event saw live streaming reach a peak popularity of more than 35 million.
"Follow your own heart, seize the opportunity, regardless of the consequences, sometimes have unexpected gains."
Although it is a graduation song, many songs also impress non-graduates.
"The whole show really wants to cry. Whose youth is full of goodness and regret, but it's worth remembering. Be brave and go on."

France Nantes church fire: Parish volunteer admits arson and widowed - Xinhua
According to foreign media, on July 18, Saint Peter and Saint Paul's Cathedral, a treasure of the religious and historical buildings in Nantes, France, was severely damaged in a fire and the large pipe organ was completely destroyed.
26, local time, Nantes prosecutors announced that a parish volunteer in charge of guarding the cathedral had been charged with "arson destruction."
He has admitted to setting himself on fire in the church.
The local prosecutor, Cenas, said the 39-year-old parish volunteer, from Rwanda, confessed to setting fire to three of the cathedrals during the night, the newspaper reported.
The lawyer for the person in question said that the arsonist now regretted doing so.
He entered France a few years ago by way of asylum and was given refuge in the parish where the fire occurred, and was taken to a church.
The prosecution noted that he had recently tried to renew his visa and was in dialogue with the police department about it.
However, the church said it was still hard to believe that the normally kind, smiling but not very vocal believer would destroy the church he so loved.
On the day of the fire on 18 July, the volunteer had already been questioned by the police because of a lack of logic in his account, but he was later released.
Pictured, firefighters carry out rescues at the scene.
On the evening of the 25th, the man was again arraigned, thanks to new evidence obtained by specialist engineers at the Paris Central Police Laboratory.
This time the man pleaded guilty to setting himself on fire.
The suspects could face up to 10 years in prison and a 150,000 fine if found guilty of sabotage by deliberate arson, according to reports.
According to reports, the fire caused severe damage to the Cathedral of Saint-Pierre and Saint-Paul, with the organ completely burned and the stained glass windows behind the organ severely damaged.
Brunet, the chief architect of France's historic preservation buildings, has conservatively estimated that the restoration of Nantes Cathedral will take at least three years.

On July 26, the Chinese news media reported that at 5 p.m. local time, Hurricane Hanna made landfall in Texas. It would bring strong winds, torrential rain, surging rivers and potentially life-threatening flash floods to Texas.
According to the National Hurricane Center, heavy rainfall from Hurricane Hanna was expected to sweep across parts of southern and northeastern Texas, causing swollen streams and life-threatening flash floods.
Hurricane Hanna was reported to have affected areas south of Corpus Christi to the mouth of the Grande River, while the Rio Grande Valley could experience widespread flash floods.
"Any hurricane is a big challenge," Texas Governor Rick Abbott, 25, said.
Thirty-two counties in the state were placed in a state of disaster due to the hurricane.
The city of Corpus Christi, with a population of more than 320,000, has closed its libraries and museums, and residents are in intensive care.
Abbott also said that the hurricane should not be allowed to inflict more casualties in Texas as the state was being battered by a new crown outbreak.
Rainfall totals are expected to reach 6 to 12 inches overnight in southern Texas and 3 to 5 inches in northern Texas and coastal Louisiana, according to reports.
The formation of Hanna predates previous Atlantic hurricane seasons due to factors such as global warming.
Generally, the first Atlantic hurricane does not form until mid-August.
Poland to withdraw from European treaty to prevent violence against women
Poland's Justice Ministry said on Saturday it would take steps next week to withdraw from a European treaty to prevent violence against women.
Poland's right-wing government cabinet said the treaty, which required schools to teach students about gender issues, trampled on the rights of students' parents.
Polish Justice Minister Jzef Szydlo told a news conference that the Justice Ministry, which he heads, will submit a request to the Ministry of Labour and Family on
That treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.

Poland's ruling Law and Justice party and its governing coalition partners have close alliances with the Roman Catholic Church and advocate for a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Andrzej Duda has made hostility to gay rights one of the main topics during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles, most of them women, held protests in Warsaw and several other cities against the withdrawal from the convention.
One of the organizers of the protest, Lempatt, told a protest march in Warsaw that "the purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence
Some protesters held banners that read, "The Law and Justice Party is a hell of a woman."
The Law and Justice party has long complained about the Istanbul convention.
Poland's previous centrist-run government ratified it in 2015.
The Law and Justice government said the treaty did not respect religion and called for liberal social policies to be taught in schools.
So far, however, the party has not decided to withdraw from the convention.

Upgraded version of the Russian helicopter card - 52M first factory at the end of the year - Xinhua
Moscow, July 25 (Xinhua) -- According to the Russian Defense Ministry's plan, the upgraded Ka-52M, a Russian armed helicopter (hereinafter referred to as Wuzhi), will be modified and replaced for the first time in December this year. The model will be greatly improved in reconnaissance, communications and weapon performance.
According to Russian Newspapers, Wuzhika-52M is called "super alligator." Its development contract was signed by the Russian military and military industrial units in April last year. At present, the first two upgraded versions of Wuzhi are undergoing transformation and replacement at the Far East Helicopter Manufacturing Plant of the Russian "Progress" Aerospace Group.
According to Russian experts who understand the above upgrade work, the "super alligator" "advanced" - Wuzhika-52 was officially installed in November 2011. The model revealed some weaknesses in its use. This upgrade is precisely for the purpose of "patch board."
According to the report, the Ka-52M will be partially armed with new protection materials that will not increase weight, and its pilot cabin will be strengthened with new equipment to withstand missile attacks, thus increasing the probability of battlefield survival; more powerful generators will be installed to power more complex airborne electronic equipment; photovoltaic systems will be upgraded to detect and identify more distant battlefield targets; new multipurpose missiles will be equipped with mainly armored combat vehicles and reinforced concrete fortifications, with a range of up to 20 km, which is about one times higher than the range of similar missiles used by Russian armed forces in active service; and defensive weapons and communications equipment will be used to maximize the utility of Mi-28NM helicopter gunships that can attack airborne targets, thus making
In addition, the Ka-52M will have more advanced electronic guidance systems, weapons targeting systems and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also said it was worth noting that the Ka-52M would be equipped with communications equipment to communicate with the drone, allowing real-time access to information transmitted by nearby drones in the air, such as images taken by the drone displayed on the cockpit screen of the helicopter.
It is planned that the Ka-52M pilots will be able to directly control the drones that they work with, thus improving the pilots' knowledge of the situation on the battlefield and the guidance of long-range
Russian Deputy Defense Minister Nikolai Kryvrochko had said in December that the Russian Defense Ministry planned to buy more than 110 Vuzhika-52M by 2027, according to Russian media reports.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Xinhua / Yao Yuanjin) -- July 26 is the first day of this year's Zhongfu.
26 (Xinhua) -- High winds and heavy rain in the early hours of the morning dissipated the heat and heat that had shrouded the Beijing area for days.
At 11: 00 am on 26 December, the Beijing Meteorological Bureau reported scattered showers (with weak lightning) in Beijing, with a daily maximum temperature of only 27 C, and a low to medium rain (with weak lightning) at night, with a minimum temperature of 23 C.
The city was placed on a high-temperature blue alert from 24 to 25, with the highest daily temperature in most regions being around 37 C and local high temperatures exceeding 40 C.
Futian is the highest temperature, humidity and sultry day of the year. There are "three volts" in the year. The hottest is in mid-voltage. The Chinese people say "bitter summer."
At the time, the house was filled with barns, and the folk had a "one-volume satin two-volume face."
According to current forecasts, the next three days will be rainy in Beijing.
The meteorological department urged the public to minimize mountain play and beware of geological hazards.
It is understood there will be 20 days for this year's "mid-volley," starting on July 26 and ending on August 14.

Engine may quench FAA emergency investigation of 2,000 Boeing airliners - Xinhua
The FAA issued an emergency airworthiness directive on February 24, requiring urgent inspections of approximately 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737Classic airliners registered in the United States, as the air check valves of the said airliners may be corroded and lead to engine aerial parking.
According to the Federal Aviation Administration, four reports of engine aerial parking of 737NG and 737Classic airliners have been received to date, resulting in urgent inspection requests for passenger aircraft parked for seven days or more and for those that have returned to flight less than 11 times so far.
The Federal Aviation Administration warned that if all two engines of the airliner's Level 5 check valve were corroded, they could become stuck in the open position, causing the airliner to lose power completely and be unable to
The aviation regulator ordered that once the check valve is found to be corroded, the air operator must replace the key component before the airliner can re-enter service.
Boeing responded later that day, saying that the new crown outbreak had reduced the need for travel, and that many airliners had been sequestered or used less frequently, "making check valves more vulnerable to corrosion."
Boeing, meanwhile, said it has advised air carriers to inspect airliners covered by the directive and that if problems are found, Boeing will provide help with repairs and replacing check valves, among other things
The Associated Press reported that passenger aircraft of major U.S. air carriers typically fly multiple times a day, but in the wake of the outbreak, a large number of airliners were grounded; as passenger travel has recently grown slowly, some are back in operation.
The Federal Aviation Administration has not released details of four aerial parking reports.
Alaska Airlines disclosed one of the incidents later in the day.
In a statement, the air operator said that on July 15, an engine burst into flames en route from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas, and the airliner made a successful emergency landing at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines said it had replaced the jet's engines and had inspected the engines of six of the airliners in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration directives.
American Airlines, United Airlines, and Southwest Airlines said on 24 December that there were no engine blazes associated with air check valves on their airliners.
Four United Airlines aircraft will be inspected, as will 28 United Airlines passenger planes.
Delta Air Lines said it would inspect 20 of its airliners, but did not say whether there had been engine bonfires.
Multiple media outlets reported that the FAA's emergency airworthiness directive was another blow to Boeing.
Lion Air Indonesia and Ethiopian Airlines each crashed a Boeing 737MAX in October 2018 and March 2019, respectively, killing a total of 346 people.
The series of airliners were subsequently grounded globally, with production halting in January and resuming in May.
Federal Aviation Administration Director Steve Dickerson acknowledged in June that the FAA "made mistakes" in regulating Boeing in relation to the 737MAX airliner.
There is also a new variety available.
The interactive knowledge sharing program "Go Online! Good Teacher" will be broadcast on Hunan TV from July 20.
It is understood that the show will create a new year-round youth classroom, and a group of talented teachers will come forward to challenge the interesting knowledge output.

They are both role models of youth knowledge from various disciplines, or a group of all-powerful "hands" who will shake their bags and excel at teaching fun.
In the program, these outstanding young intellectual role models, as "knowledge sharing officers," will challenge interesting knowledge classes.
They need to impress the audience by showing the most interesting aspects of their subject through an attitudinal intellectual output.
The annual audience of the "Dao ask the group" scene will ask a variety of questions, give the "knowledge sharing officer" to improve the difficulty of teaching, but also add a little excitement to the program.
It was revealed that this "knowledge sharing officer" included outstanding young teachers such as Li Yongle, a physics teacher at the affiliated secondary school of Renmin University of China, Zhang Xuefeng, a renowned instructor in research, and Wang Jun, a history teacher with 10 years of experience in the field. They will show the "hard core" knowledge

Lewis family: John Lewis is' fighting for the most vulnerable'
Congressman John Lewis, a civil rights fighter, is remembered as a "fighter for the most vulnerable" at a memorial service for him on Saturday, July 25.
Lewis's public memorial service has been in Alabama since Saturday.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
At a public memorial service at Troy University in Alabama on Saturday, Lewis' five siblings and a dwarf Sun spoke of him as a loving, fearless, family-focused man.
"He devoted his life to helping others," Lewis' youngest brother, Henry "Grant" Lewis, said during the congregation.
Samuel Lewis, defending, said his mother had warned John "not to get in trouble and not to go into anecdotes."
He added that John had not heeded his mother's warnings, saying: "We all know that John is always going to get in trouble, always getting into anecdotes, but that's because he is sticking to the right thing, which is a good trouble."
Lewis's siblings reminded the people at the memorial service that John's most famous argument was to make "good trouble," which was not to shy away from provoking events as long as justice was done.
John had applied to Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but at the time the all-white school, Troy University, refused his application.
John Lewis, who preached gospel to chickens on his farm as a child, eventually earned a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Years later, Troy University awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Doug Jones, a U.S. senator from Alabama, said the current protesters "are protesting peacefully and nonviolently," as Lewis did during the civil rights movement.
Jones said, "Even if President Trump were to hit a boatload of people and present all the protesters as thugs, he would be wrong.
The protesters are patriots who want America to move to a more equal country, "he said.
A six-day series of events in honor of Lewis culminates this week with a funeral in Georgia.
On Saturday, Lewis's casket was parked at Troy University for a public memorial service, and people came to pay tribute to the civil rights movement pioneer.
Late Saturday, a private ceremony paid tribute to him at a chapel in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public memorial service.
On Sunday, Lewis's body will pass through the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, he and the demonstrators demanding black voting rights were beaten in front of the bridge by Alabama police, who also fired tear gas at the demonstrators.
Lewis was then nearly killed.
The day after is known as Bloody Sunday.
Lewis' remains will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line the sidewalks and walk with Lewis through the final stretch.
At the same time, officials have asked the public to wear masks and keep social distance when participating.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey ordered flags to be flown at half-mast on Saturday and Sunday to honor Lewis.
During the nearly week-long commemoration, Lewis' body will be placed briefly at the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the U.S. Capitol in Washington.
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people could come to the U.S. Capitol on Monday and Tuesday to pay their respects to Lewis.
A public event to mourn Lewis will be held outdoors due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Cocosilian Tibetan antelope enters the relocation season - Xinhua
Surveillance footage near the Five Beam Protection Station showed that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan antelopes led by three Tibetan antelope young children passed 3002 kilometers (1,000 mi) along the Qinghai-Tibetan Highway and the five Liangbei Bridge of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway.
Experts have analyzed that in recent years, the number of Tibetan antelope young in the return sheep accounted for a quarter to a fifth of the total number of Tibetan antel
"Tibetan antelopes are exposed to a higher risk of predation during the early stages of re-migration, so the number of pups in the flocks will be relatively small, and there may even be no pups," said Lien Xinming, an associate researcher at the
According to statistics from the Yangtze River National Park Administration of Sanjiangyuan National Park, the overall number of Tibetan antelope re-migration is rising every year, with 4,860 Tibetan antelope re-migration in 2019, an increase of 338 since 2018.
"It is expected that the return of Tibetan antelopes will end in early September this year, and the number of Tibetan antelopes returned is still expected to continue to increase,"
Tibetan antelopes are protected animals at the national level.
At the end of May every year, Tibetan antelopes from Qinghai Sanjiangyuan, Tibet Tongtang, Xinjiang Alshan Mountain and other places travel to Lake Zhuonai in the hinterland of Cocosili
Wu Xiaomin, an expert in the protection of Tibetan antelopes in China and a researcher at Shaanxi Province Animal Research Institute (Northwest Endangered Animals Research Institute), said: "Tibetan antelope removal is the process of female Tibetan antelopes returning to their habitat after the end of the birth of the pups.
In order to ensure the safe return of Tibetan antelopes, the reporter learned that the Cocosili Management Department of the Yangtze River National Park Administration of Sanjiangyuan has arranged staff to conduct continuous video monitoring and jurisdiction patrols in the main return area
If a Tibetan antelope is found trying to cross the highway, the patrol will conduct a temporary traffic control at the first time, allowing the sheep to pass through the wildlife channel safely and ensuring that it will be returned with minimal human
So, how to solve the heat in daily life?
Experts recommend that summer out to avoid the high temperature period, it is best not to walk or labor in the hot sun around noon, because this period of sunshine is the strongest, the likelihood of heat stroke is higher.
If you have to go out at this time, be sure to do a good job of protection, such as hitting the sunshade, wearing a sunshade, wearing sunglasses, and applying sunscreen to sun
Wear light-colored, breathable cotton, hemp, silk texture, wear fewer chemical fiber clothing, so as to avoid excessive sweating can not heat in time, causing heat stroke.
When the hot and sweltering weather, prepare enough water to drink in time, do not wait for thirst to drink water, because once the thirst indicates that the body has run out of water, drink water at 150ml to 200ml each time, drink warm water, do not drink ice water.
The average person drinks 1.5 to 2 litres of water per day, and the average person drinks 3 to 5 litres per day.
When sweating more, some salt water can be properly replenished to compensate for the loss of salinity due to sweating.
In addition, in summer, the body is prone to iodine deficiency, people feel tired and tired, iodized tea is an excellent antipyret
In summer, eat more vegetables with high water content, such as lettuce, cucumber, tomato, etc.; fresh fruits, such as peaches, apricots, watermelons, melons and other water content of 80 to 90, can be used to replenish moisture; dairy products can be both hydrated and
In addition, people working in high temperature environments should be properly replenished with drinks containing elements such as potassium and magnesium.
Summer day and night are short, high temperature, high metabolism, consumption and fatigue.
Sufficient sleep, which relaxes the brain and body systems, is beneficial for work and learning, as well as for the prevention of heat stroke.
Experts claim the best bedtime is between 22: 00 and 23: 00 and the best bedtime is between 5: 30 and 6: 30.
Be careful not to lie under the air conditioning outlet and fan when sleeping, so as not to suffer from air conditioning diseases and heat injuries.
Experts recommend that in outdoor activities or high temperature work, you can carry ten drops of water, mandan, musk or musk gas pills and other heat protection drugs, or placed in the nearby workplace, at any time to prevent heat stroke.
Graduates Art Exhibition Moved into Shopping Mall Public Welfare Exhibition - Xinhua Net
In the season of "Cloud Graduation" of major colleges, a rare offline graduate art exhibition opened warmly this weekend.
It is not in the gallery or on campus, however, but in the public space of the Chaoyang Grand Hyatt, and is free to the public and will run until August 23.
Journalists learned that the 2020 Graduate Art Exhibition gathered 50 works / groups of 57 young artists from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, China Media University and Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts. The exhibition space extends from 2 to 6 floors and makes full use of the interior light box to display the graphic works.
Under the epidemic, the show's significance is particularly special.
Mr. Ge Ping, Head of Meichen, Chaoyang Dayue City, said, "We choose to bring the graduation exhibition to the 'cloud" again and bring it back to the offline space. We also hope that more people will see the healing power of art for society and the mind. "
She revealed that the exhibition works were collected from graduates of several major art schools, and selected from them suitable for commercial space display. The form of the work ranges from traditional racks to paintings and sculptures, to new media installations, interactive animations and VR panoramas. The volume and richness are the greatest in the past years.
In the first campaign of 2020, Li Yunxiao expressed his feelings about the epidemic through a mixture of mechanical and manual creative language. Liu Jiaying discussed the themes of "cryptocurrency," "credit creation," and "transaction" through his work on the Ethereum blockchain. Zhang Jiaying's "Catlin" and Yao Daqiang's "Tie" are animals that are often accompanied by humans, and the young artist's understanding of the relationship between people and animals can be seen.
Among the few graduates of the exhibition is Lee Kyung-hyun from the Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts.
"I came to Beijing on July 7, when I was actually a little worried about the outbreak. I also did a nucleic acid test three days in advance. I took the alcohol cotton and the test report to the exhibition."
His work, "The Mystery of Yesterday," is complex and must be done personally.
At the same time, he also took on the task of helping fellow students repair broken works.
"The exhibition will be held until 4: 30 a.m. and then patched up. The time is very tight, and it is a bit regrettable to forget to make a picture with the work.
He hopes that the epidemic will be more stable and that he will come to Beijing to see his work.

Australian University to develop new drug promising to treat blood vessel blockages caused by new crown - Xinhua - RT News
Sydney, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug that can help prevent heart disease and stroke, and hope it can be used to treat blood vessel blockages caused by the new crown virus.
Researchers found that an enzyme in the platelets accelerates platelet clotting before a heart attack or stroke.
As a result, they developed a drug that temporarily inhibits platelet clotting, thereby preventing blood vessels from clogging and preventing heart disease and stroke.
Researchers say the drug will only suppress the clotting effect of platelets when signs of heart disease or stroke appear.
With studies showing that similar blood vessel blockages are one of the leading causes of death in new coronary artery disease patients, researchers hope the drug could be used in the future in the treatment of such serious patients.
Currently, the drug has shown good results in animal model experiments, and researchers are preparing for the next phase of human clinical trials.
Research has been published in the American Journal of Science and Translational Medicine.
He became the first person to appear in a CBA rematch, allowing viewers to watch the game live.

More than 6000 pentagonal sun mirrors, each 48 square meters, arranged in a circle, such as a silver "sunflower field," as the sun rotates, reflecting sunlight into the center of more than 200 meters high heat absorbing tower to achieve power generation.
The reporter, 25, saw this scene at the Sino-Electric Power Project Hami molten salt tower photothermal power plant in Yilan County, Xinjiang Province.
"Melt salt tower type thermal power generation is the reflection of sunlight through the mirror to the thermal tower to form thermal energy, and then through conventional power generation technology to convert heat into electric power."
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of China Electricity Hami Solar Thermal Power Co., Ltd., said that the design principle is similar to the solar stove used in rural northwest China, to gather the sunlight.
The plant began construction in October 2017 and was grid-connected at the end of last year, covering an area of 6,600 mu, with 14,500 fixed heliostats planned to be installed.
"The greatest advantage over conventional solar power technologies is the ability to store concentrated heat and generate electricity at night."
Zhang Yong said that the project is equipped with a 13-hour heat storage system, which can keep the generator set running continuously and steadily without being affected by the change of light. It can also participate in fast grid adjustment according to the needs of the grid load peak
When completed, the project could generate 198 million degrees of electricity annually, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal per year, reduce emissions of more than 60 tons of sulfur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxide, about 20 tons of soot and 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, and provide a steady stream of clean energy locally.
In addition, there is another silver "sunflower field" in Shichengzi PV Industrial Park, Hami City.
Hameeflight Solar PV Power Station covers an area of more than 2300 mu, and 714 power generation equipment have been built to follow the rotation of the sun, always keeping the sun and the concentrated panel surface at a
"We use dual-axis tracking focused power generation technology, through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle according to solar height to maintain power generation efficiency."
The station director, Mengqi Duan, said that in good light weather conditions, the power generation technology can increase the efficiency of the traditional photovoltaic power generation by about 20
In the first half of this year, the plant has generated more than 7 million degrees of electricity, complementing local electricity demand.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is the largest single scale in Xinjiang at present, and the most complete type of photovoltaic module is a demonstration park for the photovoltaic industry.
The first half of this year completed more than 110 million power generation, 6 more than the same period in 2019
Hami is one of the best places in China for solar energy resources.
The average annual total solar emission is more than 6,200 megajoules per square metre, with around 3,200 hours of sunlight per year.
In recent years, the city has developed a strong photovoltaic industry and planted "sunflower fields."
More than 2.5 million kilowatts of solar power have been installed, and the city's photovoltaic power generation exceeded 1.4 billion degrees in the first half of this year, an

The article described the Chinese Consulate General in Houston as a "politically driven and very cautious" target chosen by the US government "to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of major conflict."
The BBC agrees that as the US election season approaches and the US economy is badly hit by the epidemic, Trump believes "playing the 'China card' has political advantages."
The current state of affairs is "a spiraling, tit-for-tat struggle," driven in part by the US government's domestic considerations and only exacerbating tensions between China and the US.
Trump's re-election prospects have been weighed down by the outbreak, and he has repeatedly blamed China for the outbreak, CBS News reported.
Almost every day in the US, new action is being taken against Trump's absurd assertion that "China is exploiting America."
"The Consulate General of Houston is important in establishing ties between the two countries"
The AP comments came as the US demanded that China close its consulate general in Houston, raising tensions between the world's two largest economies.
In the event of the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, in addition to diplomatic implications, Chinese citizens in the southern United States face difficulties in accessing consular services, as do U.S. citizens seeking visas and other services.
A Houston business group expressed regret that the United States had asked China to close its Consulate General in Houston, saying that the Consulate General played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
The AP believes this reflects the importance of the Chinese economy.
According to Foreign Policy magazine, the move was "part of a series of provocative initiatives that will only worsen US-China relations."
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia at the Brookings Institution, a US think tank, as saying that since the US and China established full diplomatic relations in 1979, he could not think of any action comparable to that taken by the US against the Chinese Consulate General
The Hong Kong South China Morning Post reported that the move was unprecedented in more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
Analysts believe the move could cause lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was established in 1979 and was the first Chinese Consulate General in the United States.
Currently, China maintains one embassy and five consulates general in the United States.

Embassy spokesman in Britain: Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security - Xinhua - RT News
On July 25, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom responded to a reporter's question regarding incorrect statements about cyber attacks.
The spokesman stressed that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always been steadfast in its opposition to and fight against any form of cyber
A reporter's question: According to the media, a Chinese-linked hacker group had interfered with the network systems of a British company, attacked British and American technology companies holding proprietary data, and hacked the networks of European Union governments.
The spokesman said the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always been steadfast in its opposition to and fight against any form of cyber attacks
The virtual nature of cyberspace, its difficulties in tracing its origins and the diversity of actors require sufficient evidence to investigate and characterize cyberincidents without undue speculation.
The spokesman said a series of previous incidents such as the "prism door" proved the US had been conducting the world's largest cyber heist operation ever.
It is in the common interest of all countries to maintain peace and stability in cyberspace.
China's achievements in science, technology and innovation were not stolen or stolen, but were achieved through self-reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China filed about 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6, making it the country with the highest number of international patent applications.
China has become a major power in innovation and intellectual property.

According to him, between 00: 00 and 24: 00 on July 25, 22 new cases of coronary pneumonia were confirmed in Urumqi city (5 of which were cases of asymptomatic transmission) and 38 new cases of asymptomatic infection.
As of 24 July, there were 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic infections in Urumqi city.
The new asymptomatic infections on the 25th are basically screened by city-wide free nucleic acid testing and proactive screening.
According to Zhang Wei, the director of the Weijian Committee of Urumqi City, most of the districts of Urumqi's free nucleic acid testing work have been largely completed.
He also said that from the experience of other regions of the country, there are many factors that affect the results of nucleic acid testing, such as the sensitivity of the testing reagents, the time of infection and detoxification of the person being tested, the cooperation of the person being tested when the sample is taken (poor fit may result in the sample not being taken in
Nucleic acid testing can also have false-negative results for a variety of reasons.
A false negative test is a test in which the person tested is actually infected, but the nucleic acid test results are negative.
In addition, a person who has had close contact with a confirmed or suspected case usually requires two nucleic acid tests to be excluded.
For people who have visited high-risk areas during the outbreak, if fever and respiratory symptoms occur, a nucleic acid test is likely to be falsely negative, so two nucleic acid tests are also needed to rule it out.
In view of the above, he said, for the good health of the entire city's communities, from today onward, Urumqi city will carry out two free nucleic acid testing in key areas such as Tianshan District and Shaibak District, while carrying out a "check for o

Fauci made this statement on 25 February in a web-based videoconference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation.

Mr Fauci said some parts of the US were now struggling with the rebounding epidemic.
While epidemics vary from place to place, and require tailored responses, diversifying anti-epidemic strategies does not mean that regions are not closely linked.
Outbreaks in one area can eventually affect others.

They paid special tribute to Asia-Pacific medical workers and volunteers who fought the epidemic on the front lines, and called on the American public to continue to adhere to vaccination guidelines such as "social distance" to curb the spread

US-China Trade Talks Delegates Meet in August

Analysts say the recent U.S.-China shutdown of each other's consulates, combined with other disputes, could undermine any progress the two sides have made on trade.
The first phase of the China-U.S. trade agreement, which came into force a month after its signing on January 15, provides for a high-level trade framework group of the two sides to meet every six months.
Sources close to the talks said the meeting would be "a significant turning point" for both sides to assess the progress of the agreement.
However, this person also said that if US-China tensions make the will of the talks low at this time, the two sides may agree that the meeting between Lai and Liu on May 8 has met the terms of the trade agreement's biannual talks.
Since this year, US-China relations have deteriorated rapidly, with disputes over the origins of the new crown virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea, and ideology.
US President Donald Trump, while boasting about his achievements in the first phase of the deal at the beginning of the year, has recently changed his attitude
He said at a White House news conference on 23 December that although China had recently purchased a record-breaking amount of US corn and a lot of soybeans in one day, "the trade deal is now less meaningful to me than it was when it was made.
An anonymous Beijing government adviser agreed that a new round of trade talks was unlikely due to poor US-China relations and that "trade issues have lost weight in China-U.S. relations."
However, he revealed that the Chinese Trade-Related Unit 23 was still meeting to discuss a number of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States, "we have done our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult.

Now is the best time for Chinese companies to go to the United States IPO - Economic Watch - Professional Financial News Website
More recently, companies such as Shell and Ideal Cars have gone public in the United States.
Is this the best time for Chinese companies to go public in the US?
"In terms of recent IPO cases and companies going to the U.S. next, going to the U.S. IPO essentially has not been affected, but the market is now very good, and even now this time point is the best time point for Chinese companies to go to the U.S. IPO in the past 10 years.
Yu Sheng, the chief representative of China on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange, said at the "China General Equity Chapter of the 2020 Listed Company Leaders Summit" hosted by Snowball
In April, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Public Company Accounting Regulatory Commission (PCAOB) issued a "Statement of Important Roles for Auditing Quality and Regulatory Access to Audits and Other International Information - A Discussion of the Challenges of Current Access to Information for US Listed Companies with Substantial Operations in
According to the statement, although international cooperation and coordination has increased significantly in recent years, problems with access to information remain for US regulators, and the SEC and PCAOB continue to face legal and practical challenges.
Moreover, in May, the U.S. Senate passed the Foreign Corporate Accountability Act, which places additional disclosure requirements on foreign companies listed in the United States.
In Prosper's view, the mid-cap share crisis has not affected investors "appetites.
"When the news first came out, everyone was asking if they could go to the United States in the future, but then we found out that these questions are not the same in the investor side. Investors may ask these questions during the recent roadshow to the United States IPO, or even become standardized, but this is not considered an important factor for investors to vote and not to vote for a Chinese company.
It is recommended that you take the current situation as far as possible.
Of course this time the surface looks like it may be the worst it has been in the last two years, but in terms of investor appetite, it has not been
So there will be a continued surge in US IPOs between now and the end of this year, or before the US election. "
On May 9, Jinshan Yun officially listed on NASDAQ in the United States, becoming the first Chinese company to go to the United States after the epidemic
"The listing of Jinshan Cloud gives the Chinese company that is preparing for the IPO very big confidence."
According to Snowball's mid-term stock report for the first half of 2020, 20 Chinese companies went to the United States in the first half of this year, up 17.6 from the same period last year. From the total number of initial funding, 20 companies raised a total of 2,725 million, up 52.4 from the same period last year.
According to Yusheng, the Chinese company that went to the United States to IPO in the first half of this year has higher quality, good fundamentals and growth quality companies, and will be more favored by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, the company continues to be optimistic about going to the US IPO.
"In the short term, the boom is continuing; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more options, A-shares, Hong Kong shares, and US stocks. Everyone will consider the US election and Sino-US relations as market choices and timing; in the long run, everything will return to normal. Market volatility is both a cycle, both political and economic, and eventually the stock market will return to normal."
At the same time, Yusheng said, "there are many uncertainties this year, but for high-quality companies, no matter the market is good or bad, as long as they are solid and have growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively minor, investors need to invest in excellent Chinese companies."

People's Daily commentator: focus on running their own business to create new advantages for future development - on learning and implementing the important speech of General Secretary Xi Jinping at the Entrepreneurial Symposium - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Beijing July 25 People's Daily July 26 Commentator Article: Focus on your own business to create new advantages for future development
Today, the global epidemic and the world economic situation remain serious and complex, and the challenges to our development are unprecedented.
Maintaining a strategic focus, increasing confidence in winning and focusing our efforts on doing our part are key to meeting the challenges of risk.
At the recent symposium of entrepreneurs, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that in the current external environment of rising protectionism, low world economy and shrinking global market, we must concentrate our efforts to do our best, give full play to the advantages of the domestic mega market, gradually form a new development pattern with domestic and international mega-cycles as the main body and domestic and international dual-cycles as the mutual reinforcement.
The oddsmakers win.
In the external environment of deep economic globalization, the market and resources "both sides" play an important role in China's rapid development.
The world is now undergoing profound change under the brunt of the epidemic, with more instability and uncertainty, and economic globalization experiencing headwinds and reversals.
An extremely important aspect is to take the expansion and satisfaction of domestic demand as the strategic basis for development, to give full play to their advantages, to add impetus to our economic development through a prosperous domestic economy and smooth domestic circulation, and to drive the recovery of the world economy.
We should deeply recognize that the construction of a complete system of domestic demand is relevant to the long-term development and long-term security of our country.
The Central Committee of the Party reviewed the situation and clearly put forward the firm implementation of the strategy of expanding domestic demand, which is the need to deal with the impact of the epidemic, the need to maintain the long-term sustainable and healthy development of our economy
The advantage of large economies is internal circulation.
With the world's most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity and complete supporting capacity, we have more than 100 million market players and more than 170 million people with higher education or various professional skills, as well as a super-large domestic demand market of 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups. We are in a phase of new industrialization, informationization, urbanization and rapid modernization of agriculture, with huge investment
Public ownership is the mainstay, multiple ownership economies are common development, labor distribution is the mainstay, multiple distribution methods coexist, socialist market economy system and other basic socialist economic system, can both stimulate the dynamism of all kinds of market subjects, emancipation and development of social productivity, but also promote efficiency and fair organic unity,
We need to firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, so that production, distribution, and circulation are more dependent on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote a dynamic balance between aggregate supply and aggregate demand at a higher level
To accelerate the construction of a complete system of domestic demand, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation and other aspects of innovation, accelerate the promotion of the digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, new materials and other strategic emerging industries, to form more new growth points, growth poles, and gradually form a new development pattern based on domestic and international circuits.
Openness brings progress, and closure inevitably falls behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that China's open doors will not close, only open bigger.
Taking the domestic Hyperloop as the main body, it should not operate behind closed doors, but rather make better connection between domestic and international markets by using the potential of domestic demand, making better use of international and domestic markets and two resources to achieve stronger and more sustainable development.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between expanding domestic demand and opening up. The smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive it is to creating a new pattern of openness and the more conducive it is
Although protectionist thinking is on the rise at the international level, we need to stand on the right side of history and persevere in deepening reform and opening up, strengthening open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promoting the building of an open world
The Chinese nation has experienced many tribulations in its history, but it has never been crushed, but has become more frustrated and more courageous, growing up and rising from its tribulations.
On the way forward, there is strong leadership of the party center with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, with the remarkable advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, strong mobilization ability and strong comprehensive strength, and the unity of all the people of the whole party army.
Balance treasure earnings down "after 90" instead "retaliatory" deposit?
With the balance treasure gains down, "after 90" not only did not escape the balance treasure, but began to "retaliate" to save money?
According to the report of "Balance after 90," issued by China New Economic Research Institute Joint Alipay (2020 version), the first half of the year, "after 90" is more in love with saving money: the amount of saving per capita is nearly 40 higher than
Interestingly, "post-90s" tend to start with a small amount of money, with an average of 60 of each saving amount under 20 yuan...
Using the balance to save money has also become a "post-90s" saving habit.
Of the 700 million balance treasure trove users, 134 million are "post-90s," according to the data.
There are 174 million "post-90s" in China, meaning that about three out of every four "post-90s" in the country are saving money with balances.
For now, the IMF's seven-day annualized yield on the balance sheet, which is above 2 percent at the start of the year, has slipped to
Even so, it has not affected the pace of "post-90s" payouts.
In the context of the "saving effect" of the balance treasure promotion, many young people who are accustomed to using the balance treasure are also directly converted into "children."
According to Alipay data, as of July 13, the new "Kidman" on Alipay more than doubled in the past month, and more and more young people are achieving "advanced" financial management on Alipay.
Some analysts have suggested that the flow of funds from balance sheets into the stock market was also a significant reason for the clear fall in IMF shares in June
The report also showed that "post-90s" girls tended to save more, on average 20 more than boys, and that 6 of those who held funds on the Alipay platform were men, and women tended to choose a more prudent way of managing their finances than men.
After saving money, what are your plans for the "post-90s"?
Alipay data shows that "post-90s" have a habit of saving money for the target, with the most users using travel as a saving target.
As a result of the epidemic, many "post-90s" spent money preparing for post-epidemic travel; the restoration of movie theaters also provided a new way to shift from saving to consumption.

France to increase military investment in space - Xinhua - RT News
France will add hundreds of millions of euros to its space defense budget and develop a space military force to guard against "unfriendly moves" that other countries may make in outer space, French Defense Minister Florence Palli said on Tuesday.
Pally told Le Provence newspaper that day that the budget for spending on French space military projects will increase to 4.3 billion ($5 billion) between 2019 and 2025, up from a previously planned 3.6 billion ($4.2 billion).
Under the French Military Planning Act 2019-2025, approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to upgrade its existing observation and communications satellites in the future, launch three electromagnetic listening satellites and modernize its space surveillance radar.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced last July that a military space command and "air and space forces" would be established within the French Air Force.
Pally said she would formally announce the formation of the space force later when she visited a military academy in Salon, Provence.
The space force is affiliated with the Air Force and has a strength of 500 by 2025, Paley said.
"Gone are the old beliefs that space serves the common good of science; today, space is a place where nations compete for global hegemony," she said.
Pally reiterated Macron's previous statements, saying that the French had no intention of provoking an arms race.
"We are not engaged in an arms race. But it is my responsibility to be fully aware of the threats we may face."
Pally recalled the surveillance of a French-Italian military satellite in 2017.
"Peeping" was a Russian satellite, she claimed.
The Russian side denies the claim.
Mr Pally said France would "soon" have small patrol satellites capable of reconnaissance and targeting "those behind unfriendly moves."
French media believe that France is seeking to create a space force because US President Donald Trump asked the US Department of Defense last February to draft a bill to create a space force.
Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act into law last December, approving the creation of the US Air Force, the sixth-largest military force in
Some experts fear that these US initiatives have accelerated the militarization of US space and could trigger a new arms race in space.

Experts say gathering immigration information through U.S. Census for House seat allocation unconstitutional
Civil rights groups and several US cities and counties have sued the US federal government, saying that attempts by the Trump presidential palace to exclude undocumented immigrants from the US Census are unworkable and unconstitutional.
The U.S. Census will determine the allocation of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
"It doesn't work that way," Sarah Brannon, executive attorney for the American Civil Rights Freedom Coalition, told VOA.
She went on to say that Trump's requirement to determine the citizenship of people who take the census in the census is difficult to do and "not very reliable."
Common Cause, another civil liberties group, filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging Trump's executive order.
Several cities in New Jersey, Georgia, joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, also joined the lawsuit Friday.
Garvey, the Arlington County executive board chairman, said, "The U.S. Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years. We must accurately count everyone living in Arlington County and must not let this illegal attempt to scare away people and compress our immigrant communities succeed."
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive orders.
Alabama Attorney General John Marshall called the executive order a "victory" for the state.
"Allocating congressional House seats and Electoral College seats in the states must be based on the number of residents who live in the states and are legally resident," he said.
The U.S. Supreme Court last year blocked the Trump administration from including the citizenship issue in the 2020 census table.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week instructing Commerce Secretary Ross, who oversees the U.S. Census Bureau, to submit data on the undocumented population obtained from the Census so the administration can exclude those undocumented populations from state census numbers and as a way to determine whether each state increases or decreases or maintains House seats.
Every 10 years, the United States redistributes its House of Representatives according to demographic changes.

White House adviser "bites back" at states for resuming work prematurely - Sinochem
White House adviser "bites back" at states' return to work prematurely
On July 23, the number of newly diagnosed cases of coronary pneumonia in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30 of global cases
For months, US President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for states across the country to return to work, only recently changing their attitudes and offering to wear masks in public, while his advisers have called the return to work premature.
22, White House presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway told a news conference that some state governments had failed to comply with back-to-work standards and prematurely restarted places like bars.
Conway also mentioned that previous claims that the president has "absolute authority" to decide on returning states to work are misinformed rumors.
"The president is a federalist, and he believes in the autonomy of the states," said Rep.
She defended Trump.
The "rumors" in Conway's mouth, however, are what Trump himself said at an April 13 White House outbreak briefing.
This was derided by the internet as a "rewriting of history."
Kellyanne Conway wants to rewrite history, she's a liar.
Trump called Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on stoppages.
Trump wants to push back so he can hold rallies.
It's not the first time Kellyanne Conway has caused controversy.
In an interview with Fox News on April 15, Conway blurted out, "This is COVID-19, again, not COVID-1, friends!"
She seemed to understand "19" as a version number, and was furiously mocked by netizens: Look at the paper without common sense!
Is it reasonable to sue the school after the 3-year-old children's college playground was smashed?
2020-07-26 05: 01: 11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Sishuo Editor: Wang Sishuo
Playground smashed, children awarded compensation before suing school
Correspondent Zhao Yifan
The 3-year-old was playing in a college playground when he was accidentally hit in the head by a softball team's Chen while pitching.
As a result of the settlement of the case, the court ordered the school to pay compensation to the school where the incident took place, and to pay medical expenses and compensation for moral damages totalling 20,000 yuan.
Recently, after hearing the case, the Beijing Haidian District People's Court held that the school had installed a protective net in the playground at the time of the incident, that it had done its proper safety and security obligations, and that Chen had made compensation, and accordingly rejected the plaintiff's claim.
Mr. Wen claims that during the summer of 2019, he took Xiao Wen to play in the school playground while the softball team was training in the playground.
In order to avoid the risks associated with this, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents operate in a safe area designated by the softball team.
However, the player was then thrown off the pitch, causing the ball to fly over the guard net and hit the back of the head.
Mr Wen immediately took Xiao Wen to hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with a head trauma.
Mr Wen argued that the facilities on the school pitch did not comply with relevant safety regulations and did not effectively manage the team and associated facilities.
The failure of the school resulted in the incident, which caused considerable physical and psychological suffering to the boy and his family, for which the school should be held legally liable.
In response, the school argued that the school had installed protective netting in the playground, and posted management regulations, training notices, told the playground to keep a safe distance from the training site and warned of its own safety, and that the plaintiffs could not prove that the school "did not meet its safety and security obligations," so they
The court heard that the site of the incident was a site open to the public by the university in question and that, although the school had a duty of safety and security with respect to the management of the playground, this duty of safety and security should only be met
At the time of the incident, the school installed a protective net in the playground, and has done its proper safety and security obligations, and Chen has also compensated Xiaowen for medical expenses, transportation costs and other losses of more than 2,000 yuan according to a previous compensation agreement.
Afterwards, the parents again sought compensation from the school, which was unfounded, and the court ruled against the plaintiffs.
Neither party appealed the judgement, which is now in force.
According to article 37 of our tort liability law, schools, as managers of public places, have safety and security obligations; in the case of damage caused by the actions of a third person, the third person is liable for infringement, and the manager of a public place who does not meet the safety and security obligations should
According to the judge, since, as the manager of a public place, it is most likely to know the actual situation in the place as a whole, to anticipate the danger and damage that may occur, to take the necessary measures to prevent loss or to mitigate the extent of the damage, and to avoid and mitigate the least cost of the damage, the law
In the present case, the safety and security obligations of the school should be commensurate with its social activities, in particular the obligation to take basic security measures and to inform of hidden dangers, in respect of the non-specific access to the playground, which is open to the public free of charge.
In judicial practice, it is also inappropriate to impose excessive safety and security obligations on managers of public places.
If the school has put in place a protective net and has a duty to inform, the school may be found not to be at fault and not liable.
In addition, the liability of the superintendent of a public place, such as a school, is supplemental to the liability of a third person for damages, even if the superintendent of a public place, such as a school, fails to comply with the obligation of safety and security. Under the
In such cases, the victim should therefore not have to extend the scope of the claim after having received compensation from the direct infringer.
Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for sports and fitness increased.

He is still an expert in demolition, but can feel the complexity of Liu's new role in the prequel: he broke a leg, put on a prosthetic leg, was hunted down by Liu Qingyun, who is also an expert in demolition, and was commanded
What is the relationship between the three of them? What exactly did Liu Dehua do in Xiangdao Hotel? What kind of cases have been involved? What kind of ups and downs has his demolition expert's career gone through? The mysteries are curious.

He followed his father since he was 11 years old, shook his small boat, walked along the Longxi River and went to Liangping, Chongqing, and went down to longevity. Each time he left home, he was ten and a half months
Since 1997, however, as the rural population began to proliferate in the towns, the number of inhabitants of Gao'anchang has increased, resulting in increasing environmental pollution.
Along the Longxi River, paper mills, chemical factories, and livestock farms were built, which also polluted the river.
In 2007 and 2008, the Longxi River became a stinky gutter.
"The fins are black and black when cut open."

Israel to tighten control over repeated outbreaks
In the early years of the coronary pneumonia epidemic, Israeli control measures were effective.
However, with the gradual release of preventive measures, there has been a marked increase in the number of new coronary pneumonia diagnoses in Israel in the recent past, and the Government of Israel has taken several urgent steps to strengthen
On 28 February, the first case of coronary pneumonia was confirmed in mainland Israel, resulting in the rapid closure of all entry and exit points, suspension of non-essential trades, conversion of schools to online instruction, restrictions on public transport and non-essential social activities, blockades of heavily affected cities, and joint
This series of measures quickly yielded positive results, and by mid-May, the number of new coronary pneumonia diagnoses in Israel had dropped to single digits in a single day.
As the epidemic was brought under control, Israeli control measures were fully implemented, and since June, the number of new confirmations of coronary pneumonia has gradually rebounded.
The spread of the epidemic has been accelerating, especially since July.
In recent days, there have been more than 1,500 new cases in Israel in eight days, and 916 new cases were reported as of July 25.
As of July 25, there were 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths in Israel.
In response to the rapid response to the epidemic, the Israeli Government has taken several urgent steps to strengthen the control of the epidemic
On 6 July, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed down public entertainment venues such as gyms, swimming pools, bars, and nightclubs, and introduced a public transport policy that limited the number of passengers per bus to a maximum of 20.
On 17 May, the government announced a series of new restrictions, including the imposition of "city closures" over the weekend, which would be implemented from 17: 00 on Fridays to 17: 00 on Sundays.
During this period, people will be able to go out, but shops, shopping centres, barbershops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while essential services such as supermarkets and
Meanwhile, gatherings of more than 10 people will be banned on all dates and hours, gyms, studios and other venues will be closed, restaurants and cafes will be banned from eating out and takeaways will only be
At the same time, the Israeli people did not pay sufficient attention to the severity of the epidemic and did not join forces with the government to combat it.
Following repeated outbreaks in Israel, many people took to the streets to protest against government control measures affecting their own economic interests.
On 11 July, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in Tel Aviv, arguing that the anti-epidemic policy was affecting the economy
On the evening of the 21st, thousands more protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu's official residence in Jerusalem to protest against the ban on restaurants, cafs, and other controls imposed by Prime Minister Netanyahu without
In addition, many people do not observe the requirement to wear a mask during outdoor activities and maintain a safe two-metre social distance, and in order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing the mask, many people simply wear the mask on their chin or on their wrists.
During the repeated outbreak, the school was a major disaster area for the spread of the new crown virus. According to a recent visit to the kindergarten, teachers and students in the kindergarten did not wear masks as required by the government, nor did they keep a safe social distance of two meters from each other, laying a hidden hazard for
Professor Eli Waxman, a member of the Israeli National Security Council's expert advisory panel on combating the epidemic, believes that Israel is heading for a "dangerous situation," noting that the current Israeli measures to prevent and control the epidemic are not enough and that all places of recreation and recreation and summer schools should be closed
Waxman said that Israel lacked a comprehensive plan to combat the epidemic, and that the Knesset and government departments should move away from their respective interests as soon as possible to agree on a way forward to combat the epidemic, with clear steps to be taken to include

Wu Fengfang, a farmer in Guyuan, Ningxia, but his old companion Dai Tianfu, two people in a car, from their home 20 miles away, to Liangyun Cultural Complex.
Despite the inconvenience of the two years, 77-year-old Dai Tianfu was expecting to "come here three or five years apart and get hooked."
This is an unremarkable courtyard in the Yuhuan District of Guyuan City. Unlike the general farmhouse, the courtyard often has a melancholy cavity, as well as a wonderful shadow play, embroidery works, traditional cavity, eyebrow drama and so on.
The owner of the compound, named Liang Yun, was once a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he began planning the construction of a cultural compound with a love of shadow and singing.
With the Liangyun Cultural Compound, the villagers "cultural life became colorful.
Reporters have yet to walk into the Liangyun Cultural Complex, where the cymbal tunes have been delivered.
Among those who are singing for the townspeople are the villagers of the neighboring village of Bailixiang.
From a young age, she had a passion for the cavity, and now had little fame in the local area, as long as she had free time, she would come to the cultural compound to show the
More recently, Beryl has also played webcast.
"It's a very happy thing to have a stage where more people see themselves performing," Ms. Pak said.
On the stage, the singers are one-note, the players are one-tone, and although they are amateurs, the enthusiasm is undiminished.
Just like the rustic style of the farmhouse, the "grassroots" art and non-heritage culture in the Liangyun Cultural Compound came to the fore.
The compound also houses a collection of more than 300 items in kind, including farming implements from different eras, traditional and handmade tiles, paper cuts, embroidery and shadow.
Liang led reporters into the yard's showroom, which showed off his collection of old objects, old wine jugs, three-strings, spinning wheels and so on.
An ordinary farmer builds a cultural compound for a donkey?
"Shadow play is my homegrown craft, and I've been learning it since I was 15."
Founded in 2012, Liangyun Cultural Complex is the first rural "intangible cultural heritage museum" in Ningxia. It is also the demonstration compound of intangible cultural heritage protection in Guyuan City.
In addition to Liangyun Cultural Complex, there are more than 120 cultural compounds and 79 civic performance groups in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Among them, there are more than 50 cultural compounds of a certain size, such as Shenjiahe Cultural Complex, Wang Yonghong Cultural Complex and Yanglang Cultural Complex.
These grassroots entertainers are active in the field, enriching the cultural life of the masses and meeting their spiritual needs.
"With life getting better, traditional culture cannot be left behind."
"Liu's spy war drama" once again returns to the "winning odds" to see Li Yunlong Li Li Qun's opponents "soaring drama" - Xinhua
The 40-episode spy drama "Winners" will land on Beijing TV starting July 16.
It is based on the real history of the Soviet Union and is based on the Soviet military archives, which have been in existence for many years.
Known to viewers as the "spy drama," actor Liu Yunlong broke through the image in the play and challenged a raucous "stuttering agent."
In recent years, the popularity of such dramas as "The Camouflage," "The Mask," and "The Kite" has demonstrated the vitality of espionage-type dramas.
Unlike in the past, the story is set in the far east of the Soviet Union.
It tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), a secret intelligence officer of the Communist Party of China (CCP), who, under the leadership of the secretary of the Linhe Party of China and the director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency, carries out the "Mutanullah" strategy of the Soviet Army Far East
Many of the characters are high-class spies, and they play the role of handsome, high IQ and mature perfectly.
But in Liu Yunlong's view, such a person is not suitable for spying. "Spy should be the kind of person who can not find it in the heap of people. If it is a very handsome image, it is not necessary for everyone to pay attention to you. Can it be lurking? There is a line in" Kite, "'you don't catch me, I forget that I'm a Kuomintang," and the spy is going to be elitist.
In the film, the protagonist is portrayed as a "stuttering agent."
On the other side of the spectrum is the police chief Fang Shibao, played by Liang Guanhua as Fukuhara and Li Li Liqun as Fukuhara.
The first two episodes of the series have a great deal of interest in the entire series.
Director Yao Fei used the term "soaring opera" to describe the play of Li Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong's rival drama. "Definitely the soaring opera, their two special tacit agreement, they have a great influence on me. A lot of times their plays are 'hanging"; for example, we only write half a page of paper length, I don't shout when shooting, they can play all the time. "
When the actors are in the characters and guarantee the status of their characters, they can not only shape the characters from the perspective of the characters, but also bring more viewing possibilities to the audience.
There are also many familiar faces in the show, including the famous "Mountain City F4" in "Kite," and three people in "Victory."
He and Liu Mingyang, who played Song Jun'an and Zhao Jane, reprised their roles as Tang Fei's left and right arms.
Director Yao Fei explained, "There is no inferiority in these two people, they are simply drifting in that time and in that environment."
Liu Yunlong also offered, "We want to have a sense of humanity. This sensibility means that the people around me must have good and bad, bad people are the enemy, but also to develop them, our team must also grow up."
The pair's path to the final was carefully choreographed by Yoo, who believed he would give the audience a satisfactory answer.

25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's financial markets remain active and functioning in an orderly manner, said Xu Zhengyu, director of the Hong Kong Finance and Finance Department of the Hong Kong SAR
He expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
Xu Zhengyu, at a webinar organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong and Canada Chamber of Commerce (CCC) on the 24th (Toronto time), said that Hong Kong is experiencing difficult conditions due to the "revisionist wave" and
Hong Kong dollar exchange rates are stable and favour strong exchange guarantee levels.
The banking system shows no obvious signs of capital outflows; instead, more than $11 billion has flowed in since June.
Total bank deposits have also continued to increase over the past few months, with a series of open prospectus fund raising activities in the equity market and a glimpse of the market
Xu Zhengyu said the new coronary pneumonia epidemic has put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's basic advantages remain unchanged.
Hong Kong's many advantages, including geography, rule of law, high-speed communications, free flow of information and money, and a simple low-tax system, make it a leading international financial center.
According to Xu, the SAR government has set aside HK $6 billion in the "Anti-Epidemic Fund" to create about 30,000 time-bound jobs in the public and private sectors over the next two years, covering people with different skills and educational qualifications.
To support the development of fintech, the HKSAR government has also launched a "Thousand Talents Program" to fund local fintech companies, start-ups and other fintech-related businesses to create 1,000 new jobs, hire local talent and enrich Hong Kong's fintech talent pool.
Looking ahead, Xu expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian companies to take advantage of Hong Kong's advantages and its position as an international financial center, international asset and wealth management center, and global hub for offshore renminbi operations to develop and invest in the Greater Bay Area and surrounding areas.
The Lancet Journal praised China's anti-epidemic efforts to encourage countries to learn from their experiences -
As a country with a population of 1.4 billion and a size similar to that of Europe or the United States, the new coronary epidemic is under effective control at this stage, without any further widespread transmission, and the epidemic in China is largely under control.
China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health construction for more than a decade, the article said, making China's preparation for the new crown far more adequate than that for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that year.
The authors say that when SARS erupted in 2002, China was initially ill-prepared, especially for pathogens.
When the new coronavirus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the virus species and share genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had clarified the clinical characteristics of the virus, warning the world of the threat of the new coronavirus through research papers published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research, which was conducted very quickly and rigorously under a state of emergency declared by the state, and the results of early trials of a new coronary vaccine developed in China were published in The Lancet in May and July, respectively.
The experience of China has shown the importance of investing in national health and research systems to effectively improve laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective national response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, have much to learn.
Moreover, China's experience has shown that strong research is needed to make sound decisions based on strong, high-level and decisive scientific evidence, so that the new crown epidemic can be effectively controlled.
The article stresses that governments and their leaders must respect science, understand its value and act on it in the best way for society.
In the early stages of the outbreak, the National Health and Construction Commission of China sent three teams of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risks and spread of the new crown virus, and their recommendations informed the decision to "seal the city" of Wuhan on January 23.
The article concludes by emphasizing that responding to global health emergencies requires countries to strengthen global cooperation and joint responses.

On 18 July, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival announced the official shortlist for the Golden Jubilee Prize.
Daegu's first feature film, "Good luck," was shortlisted for the Golden Jubilee Award at the festival, and the film officially released its first poster.
The film was the first feature film to feature a director, and it was his second with the Golden Jubilee Award.
The film tells the story of a comic director who returns to his rural Northeast home in hopes of turning his family's New Year into a literary film, and suffers a series of accidents.
Family members who had gathered for the film finished the final party.
In the movie poster released today, one member of the family, "Three Skulls" Wang Jixiang, sits smoking in the middle of the picture, in the background of the silver-clad northeast black land, in the foreground of which are the red lanterns that Chinese people will hang for
The red lanterns, which symbolize festive and reunion, form a huge contrast with the fallen king, who seems to reveal the complexities and tangles in this extended family relationship.
It is reported that in the film, in addition to the "three scale" Wang Jixiang's daughter is played by the actor Liu Lu, the rest of the plays are completed by the real director's family, the film's experimental audio-visual style, breaking the boundaries between drama and real, and bringing the
According to director Yoshinori Ohsumi, the production was inspired by "A God Wanted," and the family's sudden series of events during filming forced the original filming plan to be changed, with life without a script eventually being recorded into a film, freeing up tension that went beyond design.
How does the director, Ohsuka, face this "heavenly purpose," and how to continue to embrace the changes brought about by this heavenly purpose?
There is no doubt that "auspicious" is full of experimental, almost all-you-can-eat lineup and innovative audio-visual style to turn life in front of the camera into a movie. Under the cover of real footage, the audience will also find themselves and their families from the home presented in the film, and evoke a series of thoughts as the family gathering

At the end of the battle, the commander of the squadron and a fighter stand guard.
In places where the average temperature is minus ten degrees Celsius this year, a simple row of barracks stands in a mountain pass, a flag is flying not far from the barracks, and fighters are on duty in the wind to stand guard every day, while regularly going to higher places to patrol.
Fighters climb the steep slopes of the mounds and use their hands and feet.
At the end of July, it was the time when the flowers were lush at low elevations, and in Barangaroo, only the ravine behind the barracks was relatively green.
The fighters who had been stationed at the post for six years, according to Takao, said that it was their back garden, and that it was only in July and August of each year that the grasses slowly grew, and shortly afterwards they all turned yellow and were covered in snow

Chen Maobo refers to the Hong Kong economy hit again by the outbreak of the epidemic and calls on all walks of life to spend time together. -
On 26 July, Chinese news agency Hong Kong telephoned the finance minister of the HKSAR government, Chen Maobo, to say that Hong Kong was facing a new wave of coronary pneumonia epidemic, and that business contacts and economic activities, which had seen a slight recovery
The SAR government reiterated its appeal to small business owners to reduce rents and spend time with retailers, restaurants and small and medium-sized enterprises.
Chen Maobo published an article online the same day titled "The Road to Rugged Recovery."
He said that the recent high number of new coronary pneumonia diagnoses in Hong Kong was a serious situation that affected the livelihood of society and the economy.
In the case of repeated outbreaks, it is important to prevent input cases and to deal with and interrupt the transmission of the virus as quickly as possible; when the epidemic is under control, economic activity should resume accordingly.
He noted that, in the face of a new wave of epidemic shocks, business contacts and economic activity, which had seen little recovery, had also been hit.
For the business community, social responsibility is equally important outside the spirit of the contract, especially for groups that receive large government subsidies under the Employment Guarantee Program.
He mentioned that the economic situation in Hong Kong remained challenging in the second quarter of the year, but the contraction appeared to have slowed slightly.
On the export side, he believes the situation on Hong Kong's periphery remains dire.
Chan said Hong Kong's development history over the past decades has shown that every crisis hides new opportunities and every difficulty hides the key to future development.

Marynichev did not rule out that annual internet prices would rise significantly, arguing that operators could offer customers higher speeds and more services to offset people's frustration over price rises.
Chinese Doctor
Recently, with the respect of Chinese filmmakers fighting the epidemic hero, Bona Film Group Chairman Yu Dong and director Liu Weiqiang (pictured left) held a discussion in Guangzhou with academician Zhong Nanshan on the production of the anti-epidemic film "Chinese Doctor."
Bona Film hopes to pay tribute to all medical and epidemiological workers who fight in the front line of epidemic prevention and control with the help of "Chinese doctors"!
In 2021, the film will be shown as a national tribute film celebrating the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China
At present, Bona Film is being deployed under the arrangement of the Ministry of Propaganda and the National Film Bureau, with the support of the Guangdong Film Bureau and the Hubei Film Bureau, to organize the film "Chinese Captain" to prepare the film "Chinese Doctor," which is a film that reflects the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee.
Focusing on the first line of the epidemic in Wuhan, the film will be set against the background of Wuhan medical personnel and provincial and municipal medical teams. From a human point of view, it uses a unique narrative and a highly impactful lens language to showcase the touching story of the dedicated and sacrificial Chinese medical
During this symposium, Professor Zhong Nanshan also raised expectations and hopes for the filming of the film: "I look forward to seeing not only some of the more exposed experts, but also more medical personnel who are working in the front line."
He said that he had previously seen "My Country and Me" and "China's Captain," and thought it was a good way to tell the story of the big pattern from the perspective of the
"Now some foreign friends still have some misconceptions about China."
Speaking about the film's distribution, Professor Zhong Nanshan said that some people abroad currently like to label the virus politicized, and he hoped that the film would impress the audience from a human perspective: "In addition to screening in China, it is best to show it abroad in a way that the audience at home and abroad can understand and impress the audience with a true humanistic spirit."
Academician Zhong Nanshan also fondly recalled the 1980s film "man to middle age," "so many years have passed, I am the most impressed with the film after the reform and opening up is still" man to middle age, "when my foreign doctors and friends see and cry, if" Chinese doctors "can play such a role, it is remarkable."
According to Professor Zhong Nanshan, if Doctor Who resonates with foreign audiences, it will be a great success.
During the discussion and exchange, Professor Zhong Nanshan also shared his opinions and suggestions on the current international epidemic prevention and control. "I believe that people are always smarter than viruses."
Professor Zhong Nanshan said that although the virus is difficult to predict, humanity has survived thousands of hardships since the beginning of the original society. Today, modern society has advanced medical technology and social management measures. Together with medical personnel and even people around the world have a basic understanding of the scientific response to the new coronary pneumonia epidemic.

Cultural travel "red fruit" Jujingshan - the first red expo news - Today's news - Hunan Daily - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily New Hunan Client Reporter Xiao Yan
Jiaxing red ship mold, Anshan Mao Zedong bronze statue, Yan'an cloth pile flower handicrafts, Yongshun Yongxi bacon... On July 25, 2020, the Hunan Red Tourism Cultural Festival opened in Anshan.
As one of the main activities, the first Red Culture Industry Expo was held in Busan.
The exhibition area is full of red cultural creation products and special products of the old revolutionary area, which attract tourists from all over the world to buy.
"This red fair is not only a demonstration of the achievements of the national red cultural industry, but also an important platform for exhibitors and enterprises to exchange experiences and explore development paths."
The first session of the Red Expo Executive Committee introduced the theme of "promoting red culture to promote cultural and tourism heating." The total area of the exhibition is nearly 3000 square meters, and the atmosphere building area, the scenic display area and the red tourism online shopping experience area are set up.
Invited 8 foreign provinces and cities, including Zhejiang Jiaxing, Guizhou Zunyi and Shaanxi Yan'an, as well as 137 enterprises and units from Changsha, Zhuzhou, Yueyang and Quzhou in our province. A total of 768 kinds of exhibits were exhibited, including red artefacts, handicrafts, food specialities, tourism routes, red training courses
The exhibition will run until July 29.
As the host of the Red Expo, the highlights of the exhibition area are varied.
According to the director of the exhibition area, the exhibition area is divided into two parts: red industry and red culture industry development.
The Red Industry Exhibition Area displays 31 exhibits of 6 enterprises such as Valin Steel, Valin Cable and Xiangtan Power. The Red Culture Industry Development Exhibition Area displays nearly 200 products of 27 units such as Red Series Books, Red Series Food, and Red Series Cultural Creation Products.
In the Yan'an exhibition area, many visitors are attracted by the Chen exhibition's cloth flower handicrafts and paper-cut art.

At the same time, they invited the national intangible cultural heritage protection project "Ansei paper cutting," "Shaanbei folk song" and provincial intangible project Yanchuan heap painting inheritors, highlighting Yan'an folkloric characteristic products, and took the opportunity to communicate with other exhibition area enterprises to promote
Japan's new crown confirmed more than 30,000 cases - Xinhua
According to statistics, there were 239 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on the 26th, and more than 200 new cases in a single day for six consecutive days, bringing the total number to 11
In addition, 141 new confirmed cases were reported in Osaka Prefecture, 90 in Fukuoka Prefecture and 80 in Aichi Prefecture.
In the first half of the telecommunication network fraud crime rose 70 -
In the first half of this year, the national prosecution office prosecuted 58,101 fraud crimes, up 35 year-on-year.
In particular, the number of fraud-related offences is high, with the Public Prosecution Service prosecuting 43.4 per cent of all fraud-related offences.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has targeted guidance, and has issued nine of the ten typical cases related to epidemic prevention and control.
From the first half of the year, the procuratorate dealt with a large number of fraud-related crimes, ranging from the national macro policy to the general public, including epidemic-related fraud, "medical treatment" fraud, "health goods" fraud, "enrollment intermediary" fraud, "loan arbitrage" fraud, fraud of obtaining state subsidies, and national asset thawing fraud.
In particular, some telecommunication network frauds break through national borders, geographical boundaries and personnel restrictions, have the characteristics of people, cross-border, remote, electronic payment, etc., and are not specific to specific groups of victims
For example, some companies have set up specialized companies, rented upscale office buildings, set up multiple departments or posts, used legal network platforms to advertise, recruit, train and evaluate recruiters, and adopted business operation model management, wearing the "legal veneer," more confusing.
It is incumbent upon the Public Prosecutor's Office to punish and prevent crimes in accordance with the law and to provide timely early warning to the public and relevant authorities.
In the administration of justice, the Public Prosecution Service carries out its duties seriously, both by maintaining a high level of pressure on fraud offences and by refining law enforcement initiatives in a targeted manner to promote social governance through, for example,
The Public Prosecution Service strictly imposes a de facto, evidentiary, procedural and application of the law in cases of fraud, based on the facts and guided by the law.
In the case of telecommunication cyberfraud offences in particular, emphasis is placed on the central role of electronic data in the identification of facts, and efforts are made to build a chain of evidence between electronic data,
For example, in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, the Yinzhou District Prosecutor's Office handled a case of epidemic-related fraud, the procuratorate first intervened in advance, and it took only five days from the occurrence of the case to the completion of the case, reflecting the attitude and determination to deal with the situation
In the process of reviewing arrests and prosecutions, attention has been paid to the prosecution of omissions in cases, 733 persons have been arrested by the public security organs and 1,113 persons have been prosecuted by the public security organs for o
In the first half of the year, the National Prosecuting Authority issued 298 prosecutorial recommendations on fraud offences, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud offences and promote
For example, in the case of communications companies, banks, intermediary organizations and other loopholes in the supervision of telecommunication networks, the procuratorial offices of Guangzhou and Dongguan in Guangdong Province submitted timely prosecution recommendations, urging the relevant units to strengthen supervision and improve mechanisms and promote the construction
Fourth is to do a good job of chasing the damage.
Public prosecutors from all over the country have seized important aspects such as intervening in the investigation and guidance of evidence, examining and prosecuting, urging the investigative agencies to actively pursue the recovery of funds, cooperating with the relevant authorities in pursuing the pursuit of damages, and trying to minimize the economic losses caused
For example, the Beijing Public Prosecutor's Office in the case of a certain lending scheme in Lin, involving 22 sets of real estate awaiting seizure, in the event that the property may be disposed of by other cases, the first to create a "stay of execution letter," timely delivery to the relevant court, recommending that the previously seized court suspend the execution of the property in question until the facts of the crime have been ascertained and disposed of uniformly,
The prosecutor reminded everyone to be very vigilant about fraud crimes, do not expect "pie in the sky" and do not think that it is cheap to be credulous and keep their "purse strings."

In the heat, the Economic Daily - China Economic Network reporter walked into Zhonghai Village, Yanna Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
In the middle of the sun, the villager Li Yuanzhong scrawled grass in the base, although his face was sunburnt and red, but he occasionally sang small songs in his mouth.
The town is located in Weining County, because of its low latitude and high altitude, good light, large day and night temperature difference, high sugar content and good taste of the apple produced, has a certain popularity in the surrounding area, but also because of its small size and spots, it has not been able to sell a good price, and has not been able to form an
The town was formerly a poor town with a high incidence of poverty of 25.8 a decade ago.
During the critical period of the fight against poverty, it is imperative to change traditional farming practices, adjust industrial structures and increase farmers' incomes.
After a number of visits, Chen Chao and a class of people in the town thought that industrial development could no longer go the old way.
To this end, the town has introduced leading enterprises and modernized the cultivation of apples.
In 2015, Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Beyond Agriculture Co., Ltd., came to the town of Yanna from Shaanxi to investigate. At a glance, he saw the local planting conditions and began planting apple
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land out to plant apple trees, and Li Yuanzhong and his wife made a mistake: "After planting apples for so many years, they did not see who in the village made a fortune."
"All apples are dwarfed apples and do not make apple trees grow too high."
Li Yuanzhong did not expect that this time, apple planting adopted a new method, irrigated water pipes to each apple tree, water and fertilizer poured into the roots, autumn fruit harvest, tractor directly into the orchard, standing to pick the fruit.
At present, the Apple base has gradually entered the productive period, and the market is not selling, as Hou Jianwen expected, and is loved by consumers in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
The growing Apple industry has given Li Yuanzhong a new change in his life, and while still planting land, there are new sources of income.
Li Yuanzhong's family has more than 9 acres of land to transfer to the apple base, and every year in addition to the land transfer fee to protect the bottom, there are profit dividends after hanging fruits. The couple usually works in the base, "one person gets 80 yuan a day, and has work all year round
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year, the profits and dividends of more than 2,800, plus land transfer fees and the couple's labor income, a family income of more than 80,000 yuan, "eating and wearing, the days of Xiaokang have passed."
"At present, the annual output value of 1 acre of apple is more than 15,000 yuan, about 10 times that of corn."
Chen Chao told reporters that the whole town has planted 20,000 acres of apples, and in Zhonghai village alone there are 6,000 acres, covering 4,056 farmers and 1.72 million people, including 656 poor households and 2,952 poor households with established cards.
Li Yuanzhong, who is growing up, is also beginning to realize his "wish."
This year, Li Yuanzhong bought an off-road vehicle in the Lunar Spring Festival. Nowadays, he drives the car to work every day. "There are more than a dozen acres of land at home, and the next Apple base will expand its scale, and

Membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect"
New mixed matrix film preparation technology diagram
Recently, the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University made significant progress against the "membrane separation method to capture carbon dioxide," successfully developed a new hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology, and greatly improved the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane materials.
The results were published as a cover article in the international journal Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology.
The "greenhouse effect" is a major environmental problem plaguing human development, while carbon dioxide emissions are responsible for the "greenhouse effect."
How to capture and harness human-emitted carbon dioxide efficiently is a focus for scientists.
"Membrane separation method" is a new carbon dioxide capture technology, it is to separate carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane material, with efficient energy saving and simple operation.
How to let the membrane material "breathe deeply" and improve the efficiency of gas separation is the bottleneck of capturing carbon dioxide using membrane separation method.
Tianjin University's scientific research team innovates and explores the influence of different solvents on membrane gas separation properties through repeated experiments.
Experimental results showed that N-methylpyrrolidone was used as a preparation solvent, resulting in a more uniform distribution of carbon nanotubes in the membrane material and "more breathable," effectively increasing the gas separation efficiency and rate of the
The carbon dioxide separation performance of mixed matrix membranes prepared with this new technique is close to the theoretical separation upper limit of the current type of membrane
"New technologies offer new ideas for membrane separation capture carbon dioxide."
Li Run, a member of the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team at Tianjin University, said, "We hope that this technology will provide strong support for future coal-fired power plants and chemical enterprises to handle flue gas, and play a major role in controlling

Before voluntarily filling in the report, it is a professional grade difference.
Each year, students or parents who do not know the terms involved in the voluntary entry will be asked to volunteer.
This year, five universities - Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing Post and Telecommunications University, Beijing Forestry University and Peking University of Chemical Technology - jointly released the 2020 admissions policy, eliminating
What does it mean to be professional and what is the significance of volunteering?
Professional allocation rules in three ways
Experts remind that before filling in the volunteer, be sure to read the admissions charter of your favorite school in detail, and understand the admission rules of colleges and universities, including transfer rates and professional allocation rules.
Professional allocation rules, refers to the college transfer, for professional admission mainly have professional priority, grade priority, professional grade difference three ways.
In particular, it is stated in the Charter of Admission.
However, there are also a number of higher education institutions that have an overall score of plus or minus.
This means that when the score does not meet the voluntary entry score line for the first major, the entry score line for the second major is met, and so forth.
The so-called "professional grade difference" is the number of points announced in the admissions charter to determine the number of students selected to volunteer in different majors, which is the "professional grade difference."
The difference is the difference between the scores of the first professional volunteer and the non-first professional volunteer, the difference between the scores of each professional volunteer, such as 3, 2 and 1.
Take, for example.
Assuming that students apply to A university, they have 560 points. Their professional volunteers are: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce, and the professional admission of A university has a professional grade difference method. The difference is divided into 2 points, 1 point, 1 point and 0 points.
In the case of a professional assignment, if the first professional volunteer of Xiaoming meets the professional admission requirements and the professional has a planned balance, Xiaoming is admitted to the "computer" major; if the computer is not accepted, his score will be subtracted by 2 points, ranked according to the score of 558 points with the first professional volunteer registration "international trade" test, to determine whether the professional admission requirements are met; if it is still not satisfied, the score is subtracted by 1 point (or 557 points) for the third professional voluntary "automatic" admission; if it is still not satisfied, the score is subtracted by 1 point (or 556 points) for the fourth professional admission, and if the subsequent professional is not satisfied
Different University Professional Grades Set Differently
With the introduction of parallel volunteerism, many universities have now abolished the professional grade difference, but some universities have retained the method this year. From the "admissions charter" published by the universities, more than 20 universities have set professional grade difference this year.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology
At each of these universities, the difference in professional level is different.
Some universities have a grade difference in each major, such as Ningxia University, and the files have been sent to the students of the school, and the students are ranked according to the number of points in the order in which they file their professional volunteers.
And there are universities that set different professional grades between different majors.
For example, at Jimei University, the total difference between professional volunteer level is 4 points, that is, the difference between first professional volunteer and other professional volunteer level is 3 points.
When filling in the report, the candidates and parents must read the admission policy of the reported school carefully, to see if there is a professional grade difference, what is the form of the grade difference, while giving due consideration to the scores, but also to rationally analyze the proposed school and major, if the university clearly takes the score difference in the admissions charter for admission, candidates should pay attention to the gradient between the majors and improve the odds of admission
