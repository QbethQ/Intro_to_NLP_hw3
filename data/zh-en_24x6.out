Xinhua News Agency Chengdu, July 26: Outstanding returning migrant workers into rural revitalization force
Zhang Xiong, 34, is based in Orchard Village, Meishan City, Sichuan Province. In 2010, he quit his job in Beijing with a monthly salary of tens of thousands and returned home
After several years of hard work, he now runs a wine-growing family farm with an annual income of more than one million yuan, becoming a well-known leader in getting rich, and was selected into the village "two committees" team.
In recent years, inspired by a series of policies such as national poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return home to start businesses, activating a pool of spring water in rural areas.
Sichuan, a large population province in western China and a large labor export province, implemented the "Excellent Migrant Worker Training Project." In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries were generated from the outstanding migrant workers.
Well-off is not well-off, the key to look at the old hometown.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young adult workers in rural China have gone abroad to increase their income, and some have started their own enterprises through hard work.
But objectively also led to rural "hollowing out" in different degrees, especially the weakening of rural grassroots organizations, village Party branch secretary and party members showed "one old one low" characteristics, namely aging, low education, village Party organization leaders team is not strong, yellow and yellow problem prominent.
If elements such as rural talents have been flowing to cities in one direction, and the countryside has been in a state of "blood loss" and "anaemia" for a long time
Attract those who are capable, conscious and interested in serving their hometown migrant workers back, guide them to return home and start businesses to become rich leaders, choose from merit training into party members and rural cadres, enrich the grassroots cadres, which is to solve the root causes of rural Party members and grassroots Party organizations.
Good migrant workers are brought back, and they need to stay and do well.
In recent years, Sichuan began by paying close attention to the Party building of migrant workers. On the basis of strict selection criteria, Sichuan has established institutional mechanisms such as oriented referral, service guarantee, training, selection and use of outstanding migrant workers, so that they can improve their ability, secure their jobs, and look forward to their lives.
This year is the end of the decisive fight against poverty, do a good job of poverty alleviation and rural revitalization of the link, talent is the key factor.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to this group of outstanding returning migrant workers and, through comprehensive measures, build them into a task force and new force that can stay, fight and cannot leave, providing strong organizational guarantees and talent support for rural poverty alleviation and development and revitalization.

The presence of wildlife in cities has become increasingly common and is closely linked to the increasing urban greening of the capital in recent years.
In particular, the new round of million acre afforestation and greening construction starting in 2018 proposes to reshape the urban ecological environment, improve the ecological function of forested green areas and highlight the concept
In planning, we strive to interact with the surrounding green areas to make it easier for wild animals to visit their families and friends. The trees are also favorite honey and food plants.

Polish President Andrzej Duda made hostility to gay rights one of the main topics during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles, mostly women, staged protests in Warsaw and several other cities against withdrawing from the convention.
"The aim of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence," said Lempat, one of the protest organizers, speaking at a protest march in Warsaw.
Some protesters carried banners that read "Law and Justice Party is hell for women."

Poland's previous centrist ruling government ratified it in 2015.
The PiS government said the treaty did not respect religion and called for liberal social policy to be taught in schools.
But so far the party has not decided to withdraw from the convention.

FAA orders emergency investigation of 2,000 Boeing airliners - Xinhua News Agency
The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive requiring urgent inspections of approximately 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737Classic aircraft registered in the United States because the corrosion of the air check valves of these aircraft may cause the engine to stop in the air.
The Federal Aviation Administration stated that it had received four reports of airborne engine parking for 737NG and 737Classic aircraft to date, resulting in urgent inspection requests for airliners that had been parked for seven consecutive days or more and for airliners that had flown fewer than 11 times so far since re-
The Federal Aviation Administration warned that if both engines were corroded, stage 5 check valves could get stuck in the open position, causing the aircraft to lose power completely and fail to restart the engine.
The aviation regulator ordered that once corrosion of the check valve was detected, the airline operator must replace this critical component before the aircraft could be brought back into service.
Boeing responded later that day that the COVID-19 outbreak had reduced demand for travel, resulting in many airliners being blocked or used less frequently, and that "check valves are more susceptible to corrosion."
Boeing meanwhile said it had advised airline operators to inspect airliners covered by the directive and that if problems were found, Boeing would provide help with overhauls and replacement of check valves.
The Associated Press reports that aircraft operated by major U.S. airline operators typically fly multiple times a day, but after the COVID-19 outbreak, a large number of airliners were grounded; some have returned to operations following recent slow growth in passenger demand.
The FAA has not released details of the four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines 24 later revealed one of the incidents.
The airline said in a statement that one of its airliners was en route from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas, on July 15 when one of its engines stopped and the plane made an emergency landing at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines said it had replaced the aircraft's engines and had inspected six of them in accordance with FAA instructions.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines 24 respectively said that its airliners did not appear associated with air check valve engine stoppage.
Four of American Airlines' airliners will be inspected and 28 of United Airlines' airliners will be inspected.
Delta Air Lines said it would inspect 20 of its airliners, but did not say whether there had been engine outages.
Multiple media reports described the FAA's emergency airworthiness directive as another blow to Boeing.
Lion Air Indonesia and Ethiopian Airlines crashed Boeing 737MAX aircraft in October 2018 and March 2019 respectively, killing 346 people.
The series of airliners was subsequently grounded worldwide, discontinued in January and resumed production in May.
FAA Administrator Steve Dickerson acknowledged in June that the FAA "made mistakes" in regulating Boeing in relation to the 737MAX jetliner.

(China Poverty Alleviation Story) "South of Shangjiang" Pursues the Poetic "Dream of the Yellow River"
The Yellow River, which has inspired countless literati, gave birth to the beautiful and rich Ningxia Plain. Nowadays, Ningxia, which has the nickname "South of Shangjiang," adheres to the concept of "ecological priority and green development" and pursues the poetic "Yellow River dream."
River Clearwater's "Bibo Dream"
The Yellow River flows 397 kilometers through Ningxia, which is the "mother river" of the nurturing party.

"Wetland Dream"
Flying birds, greenery, plank path, clear water... The beauty of "sand flying collection" written by Fan Zhongmao has become a reality in Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.
The Yellow River flows through Ningxia, forming various wetlands such as river wetlands, lake wetlands and swamp wetlands along the way. It plays an important role in promoting the rational use of water resources and water ecological balance, and has also become an important
Since 2009, relevant departments in Ningxia have invested about 3.45 billion yuan in wetland conservation projects. At present, Yinchuan wetland covers an area of 19,200 hectares, with a wetland protection rate of 78.5 percent, nearly 200 natural lakes and swamp wetlands, 5 national wetland parks, 1 national urban wetland park, 6 autonomous regional-level wetland parks and 8 municipal parks.

In particular, China's Ministry of Commerce issued a press release on the evening of June 23, saying that China operates a managed floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand and adjusted with reference to a basket of currencies, and that the market
Overall, the yuan exchange rate is at a reasonably balanced level and is not undervalued, the press release stressed.
Since 2005, the yuan has appreciated more than 17 percent against the dollar.
According to data released by the Bank for International Settlements, between early 2005 and May 2020, the renminbi's nominal effective exchange rate appreciated by 38 percent and its real effective exchange rate appreciated by 49 percent, making it the strongest currency among G20 economies and one of the largest currencies in the world.
The Department of Commerce noted that exchange rate issues are beyond the competence of members to conduct countervailing investigations under World Trade Organization rules.
The United States, which amended its regulations in February this year to conduct countervailing investigations into other countries' exchange rates, has been suspected of violating WTO rules and has been opposed
According to the press release, even under U.S. regulations, the content of the applicant's complaint contained numerous errors and did not meet the necessary countervailing elements of financial support, benefit-granting and specificity.
China urges the US side to abide by existing international rules and stop countervailing investigations into the so-called "undervaluation of the yuan exchange rate.
Affected by rising tensions between China and the United States, the exchange rate of the offshore and onshore yuan against the dollar fell sharply on the 22nd, both falling below the 7.0 yuan mark against the dollar.
Whether the Commerce Department's move is intended to push up the renminbi is cause for concern.

The midpoint rate of the officially regulated exchange rate of the yuan against the dollar was lowered by 17 basis points on December 24 to 6.9938.

Lewis family: John Lewis was a fighter 'fighting for the weakest'
Members of Congress, civil rights crusader John Lewis, are remembered at a memorial service for him on Saturday (July 25) as a warrior who "fought for the weakest."
A public memorial service for Lewis has been held in Alabama since Saturday.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
At a public memorial service Saturday at Troy University in Alabama, Lewis's five siblings and one great-grandson spoke of him as a loving, fearless, family-oriented man.
"He dedicated his life to helping others," Lewis's youngest brother, Henry "Grant" Lewis, said during the meeting.
Samuel Lewis, defending, said his mother had warned John "not to get into trouble, not to get into trouble."
He added that John had not heeded his mother's warnings, saying: "We all knew John was always going to get in trouble, always getting in trouble, but that was because of sticking to the right thing, which was a good trouble."
Lewis's brothers and sisters reminded those at the memorial service that John's most famous argument was to create "good trouble," that is, to avoid causing trouble for the sake of justice.
John applied to Troy University in his birthplace of Troy, Alabama, but Troy University, which was all white at the time, rejected his application.
John Lewis, who preached the Gospel to chickens on his farm as a child, eventually earned a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Years later, Troy University awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Doug Jones, a congressional senator from Alabama, said current protesters "are protesting peacefully, nonviolently," as Lewis did in the civil rights movement.
Jones said, "Even if President Trump turns people around and calls all the protesters thugs, he's wrong.
The protesters are patriots who want America to move toward a more equal country, "he said.
A six-day series of events in honor of Lewis will culminate this week with a funeral in Georgia.
Lewis's coffin was parked Saturday at a public memorial service at Troy University, where people came to pay tribute to the civil rights movement pioneer.
Later Saturday, a private ceremony paid tribute to him at a chapel in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public tribute.
Lewis's body will pass through the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma on Sunday.
In 1965, he and protesters demanding black voting rights were beaten in front of the bridge by Alabama police, who fired tear gas on protesters.
Lewis was nearly killed at the time.
It was later known as Bloody Sunday.
Lewis' body will be transported to Montgomery, Alabama's capital.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk to join Lewis for this final walk.
Meanwhile, officials have asked members of the public to wear masks and keep a social distance when participating in the event.
Alabama Gov. Kay Iver ordered that flags be flown at half-mast Saturday and Sunday in honor of Lewis.
Over the course of nearly a week of commemorations, Lewis's body was briefly placed in mourning at the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the U.S. Capitol in Washington.
Us House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people could come to the US Capitol on Monday and Tuesday to pay their respects to Lewis.
A public event in tribute to Lewis will be held outdoors due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Kexili Tibetan antelope into the relocation season
Surveillance footage near Wudaoliang protection station shows that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan antelope led three Tibetan antelope cubs through 3002 kilometers of Qinghai-Tibet Highway, Qinghai-Tibet Railway Five Liangbei Bridge, Tibetan antelope has begun to move back.
Experts analyze that in recent years, the number of Tibetan gazelle cubs in returning sheep accounted for a quarter to a fifth of the total number of Tibetan gazelle
Lian Xinming, associate researcher at Northwest Plateau Biology Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "Early migration, Tibetan antelope face a higher risk of predation, so the number of young in the flock will be relatively small, and may even appear without young."
According to the statistics of Cocosili Management Office of Changjiangyuan Park of Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, the number of Tibetan antelope returning has increased year by year. In 2019, the number of Tibetan antelope returning was 4,860, an increase of
Lian Xinming said: "It is expected that this year's Tibetan gazelle migration will end in early September, the number of Tibetan gazelle migration is still expected to continue to increase
Tibetan antelope belongs to state-level protection animals.
At the end of May every year, Tibetan antelope from Qinghai Sanjiangyuan, Tibet Yangtang, Xinjiang Alshan and other places have to go to Zhuo Nai Lake in the hinterland of Cocosili
Wu Xiaomin, an expert in Tibetan antelope conservation and researcher at Shaanxi Institute of Zoology (Northwest Institute of Endangered Animals), said: "Tibetan antelope migration is the process of female Tibetan antelope returning to their habitat after giving birth.
In order to ensure the safe return of Tibetan antelope herds, reporters learned that recently Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration Changjiangyuan Park Cocosili management office has arranged staff in the main relocation area, continuous video monitoring and jurisdiction patrols.
If a Tibetan antelope herd is found trying to cross the road, the patrol team will conduct temporary traffic control at the first time to allow the flock to pass safely through the wildlife passageway to ensure that they are returned as little human
So, how do you solve the heat in everyday life?
Experts recommend that going out in summer try to avoid the high temperature period, it is best not to walk or work in the hot sun around noon, because the sun is strongest during this period, the likelihood of heat stroke is higher.

Clothes try to use light-colored, breathable cotton, hemp, silk texture, wear less chemical fiber clothing, so as not to sweat a lot can not timely heat dissipation, causing heat stroke.
High temperature sweltering weather, to prepare plenty of water to drink, drink in time, do not wait for thirst before drinking water, because once you feel thirst indicates that the body has been dehydrated, each time drinking water control in 150 ml to 200 ml, drink warm water, do not drink ice water.
According to the temperature, average personnel drink 1.5 to 2 liters of water per day, high temperature workers, drink 3 to 5 liters of water per day.
Sweating more can be appropriate to add some salt water, make up for the loss of salt due to sweating.
In addition, the body is prone to lack of potassium in summer, making people feel tired and tired. Potassium tea is an excellent summer drink.
Eat fruits and vegetables with high water content in summer, such as lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc.; fresh fruits, such as peaches, apricots, watermelons, melons and other water content of 80 to 90, can be used to replenish water; dairy products can both replenish water and meet the body's
In addition, people working in high temperature environments should be appropriate to supplement drinks containing elements such as potassium and magnesium.
Summer days are short, the temperature is high, the body has a strong metabolism, consumption is also large, easy to feel tired.
Adequate sleep relaxes all systems of the brain and body, both for work and study and as a measure to prevent heat stroke.
Experts say the best time to go to bed is between 22: 00 and 23: 00 and the best time to get up is between 5: 30 and 6: 30
Be careful not to lie under the air conditioning outlet and fan during sleep, so as not to suffer from air conditioning disease and hot wind.

Australian University develops new drugs expected to be used to treat coronavirus-induced blood vessel blockage - Xinhua News Agency
Sydney, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug that could help prevent heart disease and stroke, and hope the drug can be used to treat blood vessel blockages caused by the coronavirus.
Researchers found that an enzyme in platelets accelerates platelet clotting before a heart attack or stroke.
As a result, they developed a drug that temporarily inhibits platelet clotting, thereby avoiding blood vessel blockage and preventing heart attacks and strokes.
Researchers say the drug will only suppress the clotting effect of platelets when there are signs of heart attack or stroke.
With studies showing similar blood vessel blockages are one of the leading causes of death in patients with coronary artery disease, researchers hope the drug could be used in the future to treat patients with such severe conditions.
Currently, the drug has shown good results in animal model experiments, and researchers are preparing for the next phase of human clinical trials.
The research results have been published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
He became the first spectator to attend a CBA League rematch after allowing spectators to watch live.

More than 6000 pentagonal heliostats, 48 square meters each, arranged in one circle, such as a silver "sunflower field," with the rotation of the sun, reflect sunlight to the center of 200 meters high heat absorption tower to achieve power generation.
The reporter saw this scene on the 25th at the Hami molten salt tower solar thermal power plant of China Electric Power Project in Yili County, Hami City, Xinjiang Province.
"The so-called molten salt tower solar thermal power generation is the reflection of sunlight through the mirror into the heat absorbing tower to form heat energy, and then through the traditional power generation technology to convert heat into electricity."
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of CEC Hami Solar Thermal Power Co., Ltd., said that its design principle is similar to the use of solar cookers in rural areas in northwest China, to gather sunlight.
Construction began in October 2017 and was connected to the grid by the end of last year, covering an area of 6,600 acres, with plans to install 14,500 heliostats.
"Compared to conventional solar power technology, the biggest advantage is that the accumulated heat can be stored and can generate electricity at night."
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured by the project can keep the generator set running continuously and stably, not affected by changes in light; also according to the peak and valley demand of grid load, rapid participation in grid peaking.
When fully completed, the project can achieve annual power generation of 198 million kWh, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal per year, reduce 60 tons of sulfur dioxide, 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of soot and 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, providing a steady stream of clean energy for the local area.
In addition, there is another silver "sunflower field" in Hami City Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park.
Hamifu solar photovoltaic power station covers an area of more than 2300 acres, has been built 714 power generation equipment also follow the sun rotation, always keep the sunlight and the focus plate surface into a 90 degree right angle.
"We use biaxial tracking concentrated power generation technology, through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment adjust the angle according to the height of the sun to maintain power generation efficiency."
The station director Duan Mengqi said that under good weather conditions, the power generation technology can improve the efficiency of traditional photovoltaic power generation by about 20.
In the first half of this year, the plant generated more than 7 million degrees of electricity, supplementing local electricity demand.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently Xinjiang's largest single scale, the most complete type of photovoltaic module type of a photovoltaic industry demonstration park, a total of 38 photovoltaic power generation projects, total installed 820,000 kilowatts.
Completed power generation in the first half of this year exceeded 110 million kWh, an increase of 6 compared with the same
Hami is one of the best solar resource conditions in China.
The average annual total solar radiation is more than 6,200 megajoules per square meter, with about 3,200 hours of sunshine throughout the year.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed photovoltaic industry, planting good "sunflower fields."
The scale of solar power generation has been built and installed more than 250 million kilowatts, the first half of this year, the city's photovoltaic power generation exceeded 1.4 billion degrees,
At present, Xinjiang has more than 330 grid-connected photovoltaic power stations with an installed capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts

The US media uncovers the truth of the US unwarranted demand that China close its Consulate General in Houston

The US media uncovers the truth of the US unwarranted demand that China close its Consulate General in Houston
On May 24, the Chinese Foreign Ministry informed the US Embassy in China that China decided to revoke its permission for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to cease all operations and activities as a countermeasure to the US sudden request that China close the Consulate General in Houston on
This action by the United States government has attracted much attention, and its political motivations have been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why is China asked to close the Consulate General?
Many foreign media said it was not clear why the US would choose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but said bluntly about the purpose of the move: for the election.
CNN reported on March 23 that the US has asked China to close its Consulate General in Houston, raising questions about its political motives.
According to the article, the US government's disastrous response to the COVID-19 outbreak caused President Donald Trump's low opinion poll ratings before the election.
White House officials have privately called the tough approach to China an effort to salvage Trump's popularity while deflecting blame for the failure of the White House response to the outbreak.
The article argued that the Chinese Consulate General in Houston was a "politically driven and very cautious" target chosen by the US government "to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of causing major conflict."
The BBC agrees that Trump believes that "playing the 'China card' has political advantages" at a time when the US election season is approaching and the US economy has been hit hard by the epidemic.
The current situation is "a spiraling, tit-for-tat struggle," driven in part by the US government's domestic considerations, which will only worsen tensions between China and the US.
Trump's re-election prospects have been weighed down by the outbreak, which he has repeatedly blamed on China, CBS News reported.
Almost daily there are new actions in the United States in response to Trump's absurd argument that "China is exploiting America."
"The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries"
U.S. demands that China close its consulate general in Houston have heightened tensions between the world's two largest economies, AP commented.
In addition to the diplomatic implications of closing the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, Chinese citizens in the southern United States face difficulties in accessing consular services, as do U.S. citizens seeking visas and other services.
A Houston business group expressed regret that the US side had asked China to close its Consulate General in Houston, saying it played an important role in building trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
According to AP, this reflects the importance of China's economy.
The US Foreign Policy magazine website described the move as "part of a series of provocative steps that will only worsen US-China relations."
Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia at the Brookings Institution, was quoted by Reuters as saying that since the US and China established full diplomatic relations in 1979, he could not think of anything comparable to the US action against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported that the move was unprecedented in more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.
Analysts believe the move could cause lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was established in 1979 and was the first Chinese consulate general to open in the United States.
China currently has one embassy and five consulates general in the United States.

The Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and fought against any form of cyberattacks and cyber crimes, the
Cyberspace is highly virtual, difficult to trace and diverse actors. Sufficient evidence should be presented when investigating and characterizing cyber incidents, and there should be no groundless speculation.

Urumqi free nucleic acid test Most areas have basically completed secondary testing in high-risk areas
Urumqi, July 26 (reporter Sun Tingwen Zhao Yamin) director of Urumqi Municipal Health Commission Zhang Wei on July 26 in a briefing on the latest outbreak and nucleic acid testing in Urumqi, said that at present, Urumqi city free nucleic acid testing work in most districts has been basically completed.
Experts from the State Council and experts from the autonomous region and Urumqi are making further assessments of the development of the epidemic based on nucleic acid testing and epidemiological findings.
The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Information Office held a press conference on May 26 to inform Xinjiang about the epidemic and its prevention and control.
According to him, between 00: 00 and 24: 00 on July 25, Urumqi city has 22 new confirmed cases of new coronavirus (including 5 cases of asymptomatic infected persons) and 38 new cases of asymptomatic infected persons.
As of 2400 hours on July 25, Urumqi had 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic infections.
The new asymptomatic infected people on the 25th are also basically through the city's free nucleic acid testing, active screening out.
Zhang Wei, director of Urumqi Municipal Health Commission, said that most districts of Urumqi city's free nucleic acid testing work has been basically completed.
He also said that from the experience of other parts of the country, there are many factors that affect the results of nucleic acid testing, such as detection reagent sensitivity, infection time and detoxification time of the person being tested, specimen collection when the person being tested with the situation (poor fit may lead to the specimen not taken in place) and the detection environment,
Nucleic acid tests can also produce false negative results for various reasons.
False negative means that the person being tested is actually infected, but the nucleic acid test results are negative.
In addition, people who have been in close contact with confirmed or suspected cases usually need two nucleic acid tests to be excluded.
For people who have traveled to high-risk areas of the epidemic, if fever and respiratory symptoms are present, a single nucleic acid test negative may be false negative, so two nucleic acid tests are also needed to rule out.
He said that in view of the above situation, in order to the health of the city's ethnic groups, from today, Urumqi will conduct secondary free nucleic acid testing in key areas such as Tianshan District and Shayibak District, while carrying out "missing detection."
It is reported that Tianshan District and Shaybak District are high-risk areas.

U.S.-China Trade Negotiators Meet in August
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post quoted an anonymous source familiar with the matter as saying that Liu He, head of China's trade negotiation team and Vice Premier of the State Council, and trade representative Lai Haizhe, co-leader of the US team, are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the implementation of
The report said that although China has significantly increased its purchases of US agricultural products over the past few months, due to factors such as the COVID-19 epidemic, Chinese purchases are still some distance away from the amount promised in the trade agreement.
Analysts say recent U.S.-China closures of each other's consulates, along with other disputes, could undermine any progress on trade between the two sides.
The first phase of the China-U.S. trade deal, which came into effect a month after its signing on January 15, stipulates that a high-level trade framework group between the two sides should meet once every six months.
A source familiar with the matter said the meeting would be "an important turning point" for both sides to assess progress on the agreement.
But the person also said that if tensions between the US and China lead to low willingness to talk at this time, the two sides may agree that the terms of the trade agreement for semi-annual talks have been met during the May 8 teleconference between Lai and Liu He.
Since this year, China-US relations have deteriorated rapidly, with disputes over issues including the origin of the coronavirus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
While US President Donald Trump boasted about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement at the beginning of the year, his attitude has recently changed.
He said at a White House press conference on March 23 that although China recently purchased a record number of U.S. corn in a single day and bought a lot of soybeans, "but this trade agreement now means less to me than when it was reached."
An anonymous Beijing government adviser agreed that a new round of trade talks was unlikely due to poor US-China relations and that "trade issues have lost weight in US-China relations."
But he revealed that China's economic and trade-related units still met on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States, "we have tried our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult."
Peng Jiening, vice chairman of the US-China Trade National Committee, said it was "more important than ever" to maintain the momentum of the first phase of the agreement, noting that China has made progress this year in further opening its financial markets to US
"It's better to talk than not, though it may only be treated as routine," said analysts at independent research firm Plenum.

Investors may ask these questions during the recent roadshow for an IPO in the United States, and even become standardized questions, but this is not considered by investors as an important factor in investing in or not investing in a

The stock market has always been volatile."

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25 / People's Daily, July 26 Commentator article: Focus on doing our own things to create new advantages for future development
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation remain grave and complex, and the challenges facing our country's development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic composure, building confidence and focusing on doing our own business are key to meeting the challenges of risk.
At the recent entrepreneur symposium, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that under the current external environment of rising protectionism, world economic downturn and shrinking global market, we must focus on doing our own business, give full play to the advantages of domestic large-scale market, gradually form a new development pattern with domestic large circulation as the main body and domestic and international dual cycles mutually reinforcing each other, improve the level of industrial chain supply chain modernization, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, accelerate research on key core technologies, and create
He wins, and he wins.
Under the external environment of deep economic globalization, the market and resources play an important role in China's rapid development.
Now, the world hit by the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more instability and uncertainty, and economic globalization is facing headwinds and reversals.
We should be well prepared to deal with changes in the external environment over a long period of time, so as to promote China's economy to ride the waves and move forward steadily. An extremely important aspect is to make expanding and meeting domestic demand a strategic basis for development, give full play to our own advantages, add momentum to China's economic development through prosperity of the domestic economy and smoothing
We should be deeply aware that building a complete domestic demand system is related to China's long-term development and long-term stability.
The CPC Central Committee reviewed the situation and clearly put forward the firm implementation of the strategy of expanding domestic demand, which is the need to deal with the impact of the epidemic, the need to maintain the long-term sustainable and healthy development of China's economy, but also to meet
The advantage of large economies is internal recyclability.
China has the world's most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity, perfect supporting capabilities, more than 100 million market entities and more than 170 million talents with higher education or various professional skills, as well as a large-scale domestic demand market formed by 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups. China is in the stage of rapid development of new type of industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization, with huge potential for investment demand
The socialist basic economic system such as the socialist market economy system can not only stimulate the vitality of various market entities, liberate and develop social productive forces, but also promote efficiency, fairness and organic unity and continuously achieve common prosperity.
We should firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, make production, distribution and circulation more dependent on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous cycle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote a dynamic balance between aggregate supply and aggregate demand at a higher level.
We should accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation and other aspects of innovation, accelerate the promotion of strategic emerging industries such as the digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, and new materials, and form more new growth points and growth poles, and gradually form a new development pattern based on domestic big-cycle as the main body and domestic and
Openness brings progress, and closure inevitably lags behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that China's open door will not be closed, but will only open wider and wider.
Taking domestic hyperloop as the main body is not to operate behind closed doors, but rather to achieve stronger and more sustainable development by making full use of domestic demand potential, better connecting domestic and international markets and making better use of both domestic and international markets and resources.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between expanding domestic demand and expanding opening-up. The smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive it is to building a new pattern of opening-up and forming new advantages
Although protectionist thinking is rising internationally, we should stand on the right side of history, deepen reform, expand opening-up, strengthen open cooperation in science and technology, build an open world economy and build a community of shared future for mankind.
The Chinese nation has experienced many tribulations throughout its history, but it has never been crushed, but it has become more frustrated and courageous, growing through suffering and rising from suffering.
On the way forward, with the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, the significant advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, strong mobilization ability and strong comprehensive strength, and the unity and struggle of the entire Party and the entire army of the people of all ethnic groups in China, we will be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, maintain the sound momentum of China's economic and social development, build a moderately prosperous society in

Alipay data show that as of July 13, nearly a month on the new Alipay "basic" year-on-year growth more than doubled, more and more young people on Alipay to achieve "advanced" financial management.

France to increase military investment in space
France will add hundreds of millions of euros to its space defense budget and develop military forces in space to guard against "unfriendly moves" that other countries may make in outer space, Defense Minister Florentine Paley said on Tuesday.
Parley told Le Provence newspaper the same day that the spending budget for France's space military programs would increase to 4.3 billion euros ($5 billion) between 2019 and 2025 from a previously proposed 3.6 billion euros ($4.2 billion).
Under the French Military Planning Act 2019-2025 approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to upgrade its existing observation and communications satellites, launch three electromagnetic listening satellites and modernize its space surveillance radar in the future.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced last July that a military space command and an "air and space force" would be established within the French air force.
Paley said she would make an official announcement about the space force later when she visited a military academy in Salon de Provence.
Parley said the space force is affiliated with the Air Force and has a strength of 500 personnel by 2025.
"Gone is the idea that space served the common good of science; today space is a place where nations compete for global hegemony," she said.
Palley reiterated Macron's previous statement, saying that France has no intention of provoking an arms race.
"We are not in any way engaged in an arms race. But it is my responsibility to be fully aware of the threats we may face."
Palley recalled the surveillance of a French-Italian military satellite in 2017.
What she called a "sneak peek" was a Russian satellite.
The Russian side denies the claim.
France will "soon" have small patrol satellites capable of detecting and targeting "those behind unfriendly moves," Paley said.
According to French media, France sought to create a space force because US President Donald Trump asked the US Department of Defense last February to draft a bill establishing the Space Force.
Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act last December, authorizing the creation of the United States' sixth largest military force, the Space Force.
Some experts worry that these moves have accelerated the pace of US militarization of space and could trigger a new arms race in space.

Zhengzhou-Wanzhou High-speed Rail Little Three Gorges Tunnel opened on 26th.
The picture runs through the scene.
Zhengzhou-Wanzhou High-speed Railway starts in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, southwest through Pingdingshan City, Nanyang City, Hubei Province, Xiangyang City to Chongqing City Wanzhou District, the new line length of about 818 km, design speed 350 km / h, Chongqing territory about 184 km

Experts say collecting immigration data through US Census for House seat allocation unconstitutional
Several civil rights groups and several US cities and counties have sued the US federal government, arguing that attempts by the Trump administration to exclude undocumented immigrants from the US census are unworkable and unconstitutional.
The U.S. Census will determine the allocation of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Sarah Brannon, executive counsel for the American Civil Rights Liberties Union, told Voice of America, "It just doesn't work."
She went on to say that Trump's request to determine the citizenship of people who take the census is difficult to do and "not very reliable."
Common Cause, another civil liberties group, filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging Trump's executive order.
Several cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, also joined the lawsuit Friday.
"The U.S. Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years... We must accurately count every single person living in Arlington County and cannot allow this illegal attempt to scare people away and compress the size of our immigrant community to succeed," said Garvey, chairman of Arlington County's governing board.
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Charles Marshall called the executive order a "victory" for the state.
"The allocation of congressional House seats and Electoral College seats to each state must be based on the number of residents living in the state and who are legally resident," he said.
The U.S. Supreme Court last year blocked the Trump administration from including the citizenship issue in the 2020 census forms.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week instructing Commerce Secretary Ross Ross, who oversees the U.S. Census Bureau, to submit census-derived data on undocumented populations so that the administration can exclude them from the census numbers in each state and use that to determine whether each state increases or decreases or maintains House seats.
The United States redistributes House seats every 10 years according to demographic changes.

Smooth and irreversible.
Industrial project construction, to be put into the overall situation to go, both good at accumulating momentum, momentum, and good at understanding change, change and adaptation.

Hunan is still a hot land with good business environment and market opportunities.
In the process of recovering the losses caused by the epidemic, various "ways to find the pain points of short board," the achievement of crisis into a living story.
Focus on industry research, nurture industry, develop industry, solidly optimize the business environment, will win the favor of more investors.
The wind and waves are still ahead, but riding the waves has become the norm for the construction of industrial projects up and down the province and promoting high-quality development.

U.S. White House adviser "bites" states to resume work prematurely
White House adviser "bites" states to resume work too early
On July 23 local time, the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30 of global cases.
For months, US President Donald Trump has repeatedly asked states across the country to return to work, until recently to change their attitude and take the initiative to wear masks in public, while his advisers are "taking a bite" that some state governments are returning to work prematurely.
22, White House presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway said at a news conference that some state governments had failed to comply with re-work standards and had prematurely restarted places like bars.
Conway also referred to previous claims that the president has "absolute power" to decide on states "return to work as misinformation rumors.
"The president is a federalist, and he believes in autonomy for the states," Trump said.
She defended Trump.
The "rumor," however, was what Trump said personally during his White House briefing on the outbreak on April 13.
This self-facing operation was ridiculed by netizens as "rewriting history."
Kellyanne Conway wants to rewrite history, she's a liar.
Trump called Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed healthcare guidelines and insisted on a work stoppage.
Trump wants to push back on work so he can hold rallies.
This isn't the first time Kellyanne Conway has caused controversy.
In an interview with Fox News on April 15, Conway blurted out, "This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!"
She seemed to understand "19" as a version number, which was ridiculed wildly by netizens: Read the paper without common sense!
Is it reasonable for a 3-year-old child to sue the school after being hit in the college playground?

Playground smashed, children sue school after winning compensation
Correspondent Zhao Yifan
Three-year-old Xiaowen was accidentally hit in the head by Chen of the softball team while playing in a college playground.
After Chen compensation, Mr. Wen Xiaowen's father, Mr. Wen Xiaowen, as Xiaowen's legal representative, brought the school to the court, demanding that the school where the playground occurred apologize, and pay medical expenses, moral damage relief and a total of 20,000 yuan.
Recently, Beijing Haidian District People's Court after hearing the case believes that the school set up a protective net in the playground when the incident occurred, has done the appropriate security obligations, and Chen has made compensation, according to which the judgment rejected the plaintiff's claim.
Mr. Wen claims that during the summer vacation of 2019, he took Xiaowen to play in the school playground while the softball team was training in the playground.
In order to avoid this risk, Mr. Xiao Wen, Mr. Wen Wen Wen and many other children and parents operate in the softball team designated safe area.
However, Chen, a member of the softball team, got off his hands while pitching, causing the softball to fly across the net into the above safe area and hit Xiaowen in the back of the
Mr Wen immediately took Xiaowen to hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with head trauma.
According to Mr. Wen, the facilities of the school stadium did not meet the relevant safety regulations and did not effectively manage the team and related facilities.
The fault of the school caused the above incident, which caused Xiaowen to suffer great physical and mental suffering, but also caused greater suffering to his family, for which the school should bear legal responsibility.
In response, the school argued that the school had set up protective nets in the playground and posted regulations and training notices telling it to keep a safe distance from the playground and remind it of its own safety, and that the plaintiffs could not prove that the school had "failed in its safety and security obligations" and therefore did not agree to compensation.
After the hearing, the Court held that the site was open to the public free of charge by the university concerned, and that although the school had a duty of security in relation to the management of the playground, that duty of security was sufficient only to meet the general duty
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective net in the playground, has done the appropriate security obligations, and Chen also in accordance with the compensation agreement reached earlier to Xiaowen compensation for medical expenses, transportation costs and other losses of more than two thousand yuan, the two sides agreed to
Afterwards, Xiaowen's parents again claimed compensation from the school, and the court decision dismissed all of the plaintiffs' claims.
Following the sentence, neither party appealed and the sentence has now entered into force.
According to Article 37 of China's Tort Liability Law, schools, as managers of public places, have the obligation to ensure safety; in the case of damage caused to others by the acts of third parties, third parties bear tort liability, while public place managers who fail to meet the obligation of security shall bear corresponding supplementary responsibilities.
According to the judge, since, as the administrator of a public place, it is most likely to know the actual situation of the place as a whole, to anticipate the danger and damage that may occur, and thus to take the necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of loss or mitigate the extent of damage, and to avoid and mitigate the damage at the lowest cost, the
In this case, the school's obligation to ensure safety for unspecified persons entering a playground open to the public free of charge should be commensurate with its social activities, in particular basic safety measures and an obligation to inform of hidden dangers.
In judicial practice, it is not appropriate to impose excessive security obligations on managers of public places.
If the school has adopted protective nets and has fulfilled its duty to inform, it can be found that the school is not at fault and should not be held liable.
In addition, in cases of infringement by third parties, the liability of managers of public places such as schools, even if they fail to meet their safety and security obligations, is supplemented by damages. According to the recently enacted Civil Code, managers can also recover compensation from third parties after assuming additional liability.
Therefore, in such accidents, the victim should not extend the scope of his claim after he has received compensation from the direct infringer.
Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for sports and fitness is high.

The airline has encrypted air express services from Xiamen to major cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming and Xi'an to seize the resurgent travel market.
At present, a number of travel agencies in Xiamen have launched a batch of summer domestic interprovincial tour products, team trips mainly to outdoor attractions.
In response to the peak summer passenger traffic at train stations and airports, relevant units deployed additional personnel to areas where people gather easily at check-in counters and security checkpoints.

Israel Strengthens Prevention and Control of Repeated Epidemics

Israel steps up prevention and control of recurrent outbreaks
In the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, Israel's prevention and control measures were effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of prevention and control measures, the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Israel has recently increased significantly, and the Israeli government has taken several urgent measures to strengthen prevention and control of the epidemic.
On February 28, the first case of coronavirus was confirmed in Israel, which quickly adopted measures such as closing all entry and exit ports, suspending non-essential industries, changing schools to online classes, restricting public transportation and non-essential social activities, blocking cities with severe epidemics, and jointly maintaining prevention and control measures.
These measures quickly yielded positive results, and by mid-May, the number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Israel fell to single digits in a single day.
Since June, the number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 has gradually rebounded as the outbreak has been brought under control and Israeli prevention and control measures have been fully closed.
Especially since entering July, the spread of the epidemic has accelerated.
In recent days, there have been more than 1,500 new cases per day in Israel for eight days, with 916 new cases as of July 25.
As of 25 July, Israel had 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths.
Faced with the rapid backlash against the outbreak, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen its prevention and control.
On 6 July, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed public entertainment venues such as gyms, swimming pools, bars, and nightclubs, and introduced a policy of restricting public transportation to a maximum of 20 passengers per bus.
On May 17, the Israeli government announced a series of new restrictions, including the imposition of "closures" on weekends, between 17: 00 on Fridays and 5: 00 on Sundays.
During this period, people will be able to go outside, but places such as shops, shopping centres, barbershops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while places of basic services
Meanwhile, gatherings of more than 10 people will be banned on all dates and times, venues such as gyms and studios will be closed, restaurants and cafes will be banned from eating and only takeaways will be allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli population did not pay enough attention to the seriousness of the epidemic to create synergy with the Government in its fight against it.
Following repeated outbreaks in Israel, many people took to the streets to protest against government control measures affecting their own economic interests.
On 11 July, tens of thousands demonstrated in Tel Aviv, arguing that anti-epidemic policies affected the economy.
On the evening of December 21, thousands more protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem to protest against measures such as the ban on restaurants and cafs without compensation.
In addition, many people in outdoor activities do not comply with the wearing of masks, maintain a safe social distance of two meters, in order to avoid police fines for not wearing masks, many people only wear masks on the chin or on the wrist.
During the recurrent epidemic, schools are the worst affected areas of the spread of the new coronavirus, and according to the reporter's recent visit to this kindergarten found that teachers and students in kindergartens did not wear masks as required by the government, nor did they maintain a safe social distance of two meters, for a large number of teachers
Professor Elie Waxman, a member of Israel's National Security Council Expert Advisory Panel on Combating the Epidemic, believes that Israel is heading towards a "dangerous situation," pointing out that the current measures taken by Israel to prevent and control the outbreak are insufficient and that all leisure and recreational activities and summer schools
According to Waxman, Israel lacks an overall plan to combat the epidemic, and parliament and government departments should quickly set aside their own interests and reach agreement on combating the epidemic, with clear steps including restrictions on different sectors.

Ningxia Guyuan farmer Wu Fengfang but his old companion Dai Tianfu, two people in a car, from their home 20 miles away, to Liang Yun cultural compound.
Despite these two years of leg trouble, 77-year-old Dai Tianfu still expects to "come here every three to five years, after the addiction."
This is an unremarkable yard in Yuanzhou District, Guyuan City. Unlike the general farmyard, the yard often sends out melodious Qin cavity, and there are wonderful shadow plays, embroidery works, traditional Qin cavity, Emei Hu opera and so on.
The owner of the compound, named Liang Yun, was once a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he began planning the construction of a cultural compound.
With the Liang Yun Cultural Compound, the cultural life of the villagers has become colorful.
The reporter had not yet entered the Liang Yun cultural compound, and Qin's tunes had passed out.
She was singing the Qin excerpt for the townspeople.
She has loved Qin since she was a child and is now well known in the local area. As long as she has free time, she will come to the cultural compound to perform shows for her folks.
More recently, Parkinson has played a webcast.
"It's a very happy thing to have a stage where more people can see themselves performing," Parkinson said.
On the stage, the singers glanced at each other, and the players played one tune, although they were amateurs, but their enthusiasm was undiminished.
Like the rustic style of the farmyard, outside the Qin cavity, the "grassroots" art and non-heritage culture in the Liang Yun cultural compound flared up.
The compound also contains more than 300 pieces of farming utensils from different eras, traditional and handmade tiles, paper cuttings, embroidery, shadows and other objects.
Liang Yun led reporters into the courtyard exhibition hall, which showed his collection of old objects, old wine bottles, three strings, spinning carts, etc.
An ordinary farmer builds a cultural compound for what?
"Shadow play is my home-grown craft and I've been learning it since I was 15 years old."
Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard was established in 2012, becoming the first rural "intangible cultural heritage exhibition hall" in Ningxia and also a demonstration compound for intangible cultural heritage protection in Guyuan City.
In addition to the Liangyun cultural compound, there are also more than 120 cultural compounds and 79 folk performance groups in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Among them, there are more than 50 cultural compounds of a certain size, such as Shenjiahe Cultural Courtyard, Wang Yonghong Cultural Courtyard and Yang Lang Cultural Courtyard, covering townships and streets of Yuanzhou District, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grassroots artists are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the masses and meeting their spiritual needs.
"As life gets better and better, traditional culture cannot be left behind."
"Liu's spy war drama" returns again "odds of victory" to see Liu Yunlong Li Li Liqun opponents "rapid play" - Xinhua
The 40-episode spy war drama "Victory" will be released on Beijing TV on July 16.
Chances of Victory is based on real historical facts and is based on Soviet military archives that have been closed for many years and first appeared.
Liu Yunlong, an actor known to viewers as "spy drama," broke through his image in the play, challenging a happy "stuttering agent."
In recent years, the popularity of such dramas as "The Disguise," "The Mask," and "The Kite" proves that espionage dramas have strong vitality.
Unlike previous espionage films, Victory takes a global perspective, extending the story to the Soviet Far East.
Set in the final stages of the Sino-Japanese War of 1944, it tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), a secret CCP intelligence worker who, under the leadership of Linhe Provincial Party Secretary of the Chinese Underground Party and the head of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Service, carries out the strategic operation "Mudan
In many espionage dramas, the main character as a senior spy, one appearance is handsome, high IQ, mature perfect image.
But in Liu Yunlong's view, such a person is not suitable for spying. "Spies should be the kind of people who can't be found in the pile. If the appearance is the kind of very handsome image. I hope everyone should pay attention to you. Can they still lurk?" Kite "has a line," You don't come to arrest me. I forget that I am a Kuomintang. "
So in "Winning odds," Liu Yunlong ingeniously designed his protagonist, Tang Fei, as a "stuttering agent" with joy.
The other side of the story is supported by the Japanese Fukuhara played by Leung Guan-hua and the police chief Fang Sebo played by Li Liqun.
There are a lot of people in the world, and there are a lot of people in the world.
Director Cao Fei used the term "drag play" to describe Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong's rival play. "Absolutely drag play, they two particularly tacit understanding, this kind of understanding on them is very impactful to me. Many times their play is' hang now," for example, we only write half the length of the page, I don't stop shooting, they can continue to perform. "
When the actors are in the role and ensure their character status, they can not only shape the role from the perspective of the characters, but also bring more possibilities to the audience. Cao Fei said such plays are good enough.
In the play, you can also see many familiar faces in "Yoo's spy drama," "Kite" in the famous and powerful "mountain city F4," in "odds" also gathered three.
Hou Hao and Liu Mingyang, who had previously played Song Yan'an and Zhao Jianzhi, again played Tang Fei's left and right arm.
Director Tan Fei said, "There is no inferiority in these two people. They just drifted along in that era and that environment."
Liu Yunlong also offered, "We want to have a human touch. This human touch means that people around me must have good and bad, bad people are enemies, but also to develop them, our team must also grow up."
The end of the series is also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, who believes that he will give the audience a satisfactory answer.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 25 / PRNewswire / -- Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury of the HKSAR Government Xu Zhengyu said that Hong Kong's financial market
He expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
Speaking at a webinar co-organised by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong-Canadian Chamber of Commerce (HKCA) on September 24 (Toronto time), Mr Koh said that Hong Kong is experiencing difficult conditions due to the "amendment storm" and
The Hong Kong dollar is stable and skewed towards the strong exchange guarantee level.
There are no obvious signs of outflows from the banking system; instead, more than $11 billion has flowed in since June.
Total bank deposits have also continued to increase over the past few months, with a string of public offerings and rising market volumes.
Koh said the COVID-19 outbreak has put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's fundamental strengths remain unchanged.
Hong Kong's many advantages, including geography, rule of law, high-speed communications, free flow of information and capital, and simple and low tax regime, continue to make Hong Kong a leading international financial centre.
The HKSAR Government has set aside HK $6 billion in the Epidemic Prevention and Epidemic Fund to create about 30,000 time-limited jobs in the public and private sectors over the next two years, covering people with different skills and qualifications.

The Lancet article praises China's efforts to combat the epidemic and encourage countries to learn from experience
The Lancet said that China, as a country with a population of 1.4 billion people, similar in size to Europe or the United States, has effectively controlled the new coronavirus epidemic at this stage, without any further widespread transmission, largely controlling the domestic epidemic.
China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health over the past decade, making China much better prepared for the new crown than it was for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the article said.
At the time of the SARS outbreak in 2002, China was initially ill-prepared, especially when the pathogen could not be identified, the authors say
When the coronavirus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the virus species and shared genome sequencing data internationally on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had elucidated the clinical characteristics of the virus, warning the world of the coronavirus threat through research papers published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research, which has been carried out very quickly and rigorously through close domestic cooperation following the declaration of a state of emergency, with the results of early trials of a new coronavirus vaccine developed in China published in the Lancet in May and July, respectively.
China's experience shows that it is important to invest in national health and research systems to effectively improve laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for rapid and effective national responses to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are well worth learning from.
Moreover, China's experience has shown that strong, high-level and decisive decision-making based on scientific evidence is necessary for COVID-19 to be effectively controlled.
The article stresses that governments and their leaders must respect science, understand its value and act on it in the best interests of society.
In the early days of the outbreak, China's National Health Construction Commission sent three teams of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the COVID-19 virus. Their recommendations provided the basis for Wuhan's decision to "seal the city" on January 23; when experts raised the need and urgency of building a cabin hospital, the government quickly made the decision and quickly implemented it; and widespread community and public participation allowed the outbreak to be quickly and effectively
The paper concludes by stressing that countries need to strengthen global cooperation and joint responses to global health emergencies.

According to statistics, there were 239 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on March 26, and more than 200 new cases per day for six consecutive days.
In addition, 141 new cases were confirmed in Osaka prefecture, 90 in Fukuoka prefecture and 80 in Aichi prefecture.
Telecommunications network fraud crime rose 70 percent in the first half of the year
On July 26, according to the Supreme Inspection website news, in the first half of this year, the national procuratorate prosecuted 58,101 people for fraud crimes, up 35 year-on-year.
In particular, among the crimes against epidemic prevention and control, fraud crimes are more frequent. The number of fraud crimes prosecuted by the procuratorate accounts for 43.4 percent of the total number of crimes against epidemic
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance, and has issued ten batches of typical cases involving epidemic prevention and control, involving a total of nine fraud crimes.
In the first half of the year, the procuratorate handled many cases involving fraud crimes, ranging from the national macro policy, down to people's food, clothing and housing, including epidemic-related fraud, "medical care" fraud, "health care products" fraud, "enrollment intermediary" fraud, "routine loan" fraud, fraudulent state subsidies fraud, national assets thawing fraud and so on.
In particular, some telecommunications network frauds break through national borders, geographical areas and personnel restrictions, have the characteristics of people involved, cross-border, remote, electronic payment, not specific victim groups, large harm.
For example, some set up specialized companies, rent high-grade office buildings, set up multiple departments or posts, using legitimate network platform publicity, recruitment, training and assessment of recruiters, using enterprise operation mode management, clothed in a "legitimate cloak," more confusing.
It is incumbent upon the procuratorate to punish and prevent crimes in accordance with law, and issue timely warnings to the public and relevant departments.
In handling judicial cases, the procuratorial authorities earnestly perform their duties. They not only maintain a high pressure on fraud crimes, but also targetively refine various law enforcement initiatives and promote social governance through the production and issuance of prosecutorial
The procuratorial authorities strictly control the facts, evidence, procedures and application of the law in cases of arrest and prosecution of fraud, taking the facts as the basis and the law as the standard, and doing so without hesitation.
In particular, for telecommunications network fraud crimes, emphasis is placed on the central role of electronic data in determining facts, and efforts are made to build a chain of evidence corroborating each other between electronic data, verbal evidence, and
For example, in case of epidemic-related fraud handled by Yinzhou District Procuratorate of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, the procuratorate intervened in advance at the first time. It took only 5 days from the occurrence of the case to its conclusion, reflecting the attitude and determination to handle it strictly and maintain the overall
In examining arrests and reviewing prosecutions, attention was paid to the pursuit of missing offenders in cases, correcting the omissions of 733 people by public security organs and reviewing and prosecuting 1,113 co-defendants.
In the first half of the year, national procuratorial authorities issued 298 prosecutorial recommendations on fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promote deep
For example, in response to the loopholes found in the regulation of telecommunications networks such as telecommunications enterprises, banks and intermediary organizations, the Guangdong Provincial Procuratorate and the Dongguan Procuratorate put forward timely prosecutorial recommendations, urging relevant units to strengthen supervision and improve mechanisms to promote long-term system
Fourth, do a good job in chasing damage.
Local procuratorates seize important links such as intervening in investigation and guiding evidence collection, reviewing and prosecuting, and urge them to actively pursue stolen money, cooperate with relevant departments to do a good job in recovering damages, and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud crimes to the people.
For example, the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate handled the case of Lin certain type of loan, the case involved 22 sets of real estate waiting to be sealed up, in the case that the real estate may be disposed of in advance by other cases, the first to issue a "stay of execution letter," timely delivery to the relevant court, recommended that the previous seal-up court suspend the execution of the property involved in the case, until the facts of the crime are

The heat is scorching, Economic Daily - China Economic Network reporter walked into Zhonghai Village, Juna Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
Under the hot sun, villager Li Yuanzhong scrawls in the base, although his face is tanned red, but his mouth humming a few small songs from time to time.
Weining County, where the town is located, because of low latitude, high altitude, sufficient light, large temperature difference between day and night, high sugar content, good taste, has a certain reputation in the surrounding area, but also because of small size, spots, has not been able to sell a good price, failed to form an industrial scale.
Juna Town used to be a poor township "Baogu artichoke in spring and autumn," 10 years ago the local poverty rate was 25.8.
In the crucial period of poverty alleviation into the decisive battle, change traditional cultivation habits, adjust the industrial structure, increase farmers' income is urgent.
Chen Chao, secretary of the town party committee and a group of people in the town after many visits, believes that industrial development can no longer go the old way.
For this reason, leading companies were brought in to grow apples in a modern way.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Chaoyue Agriculture Co., Ltd., came to Weina Town from Shaanxi Province in 2015 to investigate. At first glance, he appreciated the local planting conditions.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land to plant apple trees. The two men were guilty: "After planting apples for so many years, I didn't see anyone growing apples in the village to make a fortune."
"All the apples are dwarf apples and won't make the tree grow too high."
What Li Yuanzhong did not expect is that this time apple planting using a new method, irrigation pipes are laid under each apple tree, water and fertilizer are poured to the roots, autumn harvest fruit, tractors directly into the orchard, standing can pick fruit.
At present, the Apple base has gradually entered the rich production period, the market is also as expected by Hou Jianwen, Apple does not sell well, loved by consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities.
The growing apple industry has changed Li Yuanzhong's life, and while still cultivating land, there are new sources of income.
Li Yuanzhong family has more than 9 acres of land transferred to the apple base, every year in addition to keeping the bottom of the land circulation fees, after hanging fruit there are profit dividends, the couple usually work in the base, "one person can get 80 yuan per day, work all year round."
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year profit dividends of more than 2800 yuan, plus land transfer fees and the couple's labor income, a family income of more than 80,000 yuan, "eat and wear immortal, well-off days have passed."
"At present, it has begun to see results, the annual output value of 1 mu of apple is more than 15,000 yuan, which is about 10 times that of corn
Chen Chao told reporters that the whole town currently planted 20,000 acres of apples, only in Zhonghai Village has 6,000 acres, covering 4056 farmers, 17,200 people, including 656 poor households, 2952 people, a year pay wages of more than 6 million yuan, the real realization of the base built in front of the door, work do not have to go outside.
Li Yuanzhong began to realize his "wish."
This year's Lunar Spring Festival, Li Yuanzhong bought an off-road vehicle, now driving every day to work, "there are still ten acres of land at home, waiting for the next step Apple base to expand the scale, all transferred to them, more income."
Membrane separation technology helps break the "greenhouse effect"
Membrane separation technology helps break the "greenhouse effect"
Schematic diagram of new hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology
Recently, Tianjin University atmospheric environment and bioenergy team has made significant progress in "carbon dioxide capture by membrane separation method," successfully developed a new hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology, greatly improving the carbon dioxide capture performance of film materials.
The results were published as a cover article in the international journal Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology.
The "greenhouse effect" is a major environmental problem afflicting human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are responsible for the "greenhouse effect."
How to efficiently capture and use carbon dioxide emitted by humans is a major concern for scientists.
"Membrane Separation Method" is an emerging carbon dioxide capture technology, which separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane material, which has the characteristics of efficient energy saving and simple operation.
How to make the membrane material "breathe deeply" and improve the efficiency of gas separation is the bottleneck difficulty of using membrane separation method to capture carbon dioxide.
Tianjin University scientific research team innovative ideas, through repeated experiments, to investigate the effect of different solvents on membrane gas separation performance.
Experimental results show that with N-methylpyrrolidone as the preparation solvent, the carbon nanotubes in the generated membrane material are more evenly distributed and "more breathable," effectively improving the gas separation efficiency and rate of the membrane material
Mixed matrix membranes prepared with this new technology have carbon dioxide separation properties close to the current theoretical separation limit of such membrane materials.
"New technologies provide new ideas for capturing CO2 by membrane separation."
"We hope this technology can provide strong support for future coal-fired power plants and chemical companies to deal with flue gases, and play a major role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions," said Li Yun, a member of Tianjin University's atmospheric environment and bioenergy

Know before volunteering Is professional grade difference
Every year, there are students or parents who do not understand the terms involved in the volunteer registration, which can affect the volunteer registration.
This year, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University and Beijing University of Chemical Technology jointly released their 2020 admissions policies, eliminating professional grades.
What does professional grade mean and what is important in volunteering?
There are three ways to assign specialization rules
Experts remind that before filling in the volunteer, be sure to read the admissions charter of your favorite school, understand the admission rules of universities, including transfer ratio, professional allocation rules and so on.
Major allocation rules, refers to the college transfer, there are major priority, score priority, professional grade difference three ways of admission.
The specific method used by universities will be specified in the Admissions Charter.
However, there are also some universities where the admission principle is total priority and there is no grade difference between majors.
In other words, candidates within the scope of admission will be lined up according to the total score, when the score does not reach the first major volunteer admission score line, then see whether the second major volunteer admission score line is reached, and so on until the admission to the last major volunteer, there is no grade difference between
The so-called "professional grade difference" is when universities arrange candidates for major, according to the admission charter published one or several score values, to determine the selection of different professional volunteer candidates for admission major, this score value is "professional grade difference."
That is, the difference in the score between the first professional volunteer and the first professional volunteer, the difference between the professional volunteer scores, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point.
For example.
Assuming that the student Xiao Ming applied for the A college and took the exam with 560 points, their professional volunteers were: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce. The professional grade difference is divided into 2 points, 1 point, 1 point and 0 points.
At the time of major assignment, if Xiao Ming's first professional volunteer meets the requirements for professional admission and the major has a planned balance, then Xiao Ming is admitted to the "computer" major; if the computer is not accepted, his score will be subtracted by 2 points, according to the score of 558 points with the first professional volunteer candidate for "international trade," to determine whether they meet the requirements for professional admission; if still not met, the score is subtracted by 1 point (i.e. 557 points) for the third professional volunteer "automated" admission; if still not met, the score is subtracted by 1 point (i.e. 556 points) for admission to the fourth major, if the subsequent major still does not meet its professional
Different university level settings
With the popularity of parallel volunteerism, many universities have now abolished the professional grade difference, but this year some universities still retain this method, from the university announced the "Admission Charter," this year, mainly more than 20 universities set professional grade difference.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology
Each of these universities has different levels of specialization.
Some universities have grade differences in each major, such as Ningxia University, files have been sent to the candidates at the school, according to the order in which candidates fill out their professional volunteer, decreasing by 1 point and then sorted by score.
And some universities set different grades between different majors.
For example, Jimei University, the total score of professional volunteer grade difference is 4 points, that is, the first professional volunteer and other professional volunteer grade difference is 3 points, there is no grade difference between other professional volunteers, considered as parallel volunteer, other professional volunteer and conditioning professional volunteer grade difference is 1 point.
When filling in the volunteer application, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the reported school to see if there is any professional grade difference, the form of grade difference is how, in full consideration of the score at the same time, but also a reasonable analysis of the proposed schools and majors, if the institutions in the admission charter clearly take the grade difference way for admission, candidates in the choice of major, pay attention to the gradient between each major

At the same time, the Provincial General Manager connects with various Internet recruitment platforms such as human resources departments and Zhilian recruitment, pushes recruitment information to difficult workers, and provides employment advice and career guidance services.
