今年34岁的张雄家在四川眉山市果园村，2010年他辞掉北京月薪上万的工作返乡创业。	Zhang Xiong, age 34, is a resident of Guoyuan Village in Meishan City, Sichuan Province who quit his job with a salary over 10,000 yuan in Beijing and returned to his hometown to start a business in 2010.	Zhang Xiong, 34, returned to his hometown in 2010 after quitting his job in Beijing with a monthly salary of tens of thousands.

经过几年打拼，如今他经营的葡萄种植家庭农场年收入超过百万元，成为小有名气的致富带头人，还被选拔进入村“两委”班子。	After a few years of effort, his family’s vinery now earns an annual income of over a million yuan, he has gained a small amount of fame for being a wealth creator, and he has also been selected as a member of the village’s “Two Committees”.	After a few years of struggle, he now runs a wine-growing family farm with an annual income of more than $1 million, becoming a well-known leader in wealth, and is selected to enter the village's "two committees."	After several years of hard work, he now runs a wine-growing family farm with an annual income of more than one million yuan, becoming a well-known leader in getting rich, and was selected into the village "two committees" team.
近年来，在国家脱贫攻坚、乡村振兴等一系列支农惠农政策激励感召下，越来越多像张雄一样的优秀农民工选择返乡创业，激活了乡村一池春水。	In recent years, national policies to alleviate poverty, revitalize rural areas, and benefit farmers and agriculture have inspired an increasing number of people outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong to return to their hometowns to start their own businesses, which has become a new source of growth for rural areas.	In recent years, under the inspiration of a series of agricultural and welfare policies such as national poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, more and more outstanding rural workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return to their villages and start businesses, activating a rural spring.	In recent years, inspired by a series of policies such as national poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return home to start businesses, activating a pool of spring water in rural areas.
我国西部人口大省、劳务输出大省四川，因势利导实施“优秀农民工回引培养工程”，仅2019年，就从回引的优秀农民工中产生村党支部书记8000余名，培育村后备力量6.1万名，发展党员2万余名，为打赢脱贫攻坚战和实施乡村振兴战略提供有力保证。	Sichuan is a western Chinese province with a large population and that produces high labor outflows, but thanks to the province’s “Outstanding Rural Migrant Worker Return Incentives and Cultivation Project”, in 2019 alone, the program has produced more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries from returned outstanding rural migrant workers, brought back and cultivated a labor force of 61,000 for villages, and produced over 20,000 new Party members, creating a powerful guarantee in the fight to eliminate poverty and implement rural revitalization strategies.	In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries and 61,000 village reserve members have been raised from among the outstanding rural workers, and 20,000 development party members have been nurtured.	Sichuan, a large population province in western China and a large labor export province, implemented the "Excellent Migrant Worker Training Project." In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries were generated from the outstanding migrant workers.
小康不小康，关键看老乡。	Hometowns are the key to moderate prosperity.	He is not happy, but looks at the old town.	Well-off is not well-off, the key to look at the old hometown.
改革开放以来，我国农村大量青壮年劳动力外出务工增收，有的通过打拼创办了自己的企业。	Since reform and opening up, huge numbers of young in China have left rural villages to seek work elsewhere, and some, through their own hard work, have managed to start their own companies.	Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young people in rural China have gone out to work to increase their income, some of them starting their own enterprises through struggle	Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young adult workers in rural China have gone abroad to increase their income, and some have started their own enterprises through hard work.
但客观上也导致农村“空心化”不同程度地出现，特别是农村基层组织弱化，村党支部书记和党员队伍均呈现出“一老一低”特征，即年龄老化、学历偏低，村党组织带头人队伍不强、青黄不接问题突出。	But objectively speaking, to varying degrees, it has also led to the “hollowing out” of Chinese villages, especially those where grassroots organizations are weak, and led to the “aging and lowering” phenomenon among village Party branch secretaries and cadres, in which these groups are both getting older and have lower educational attainment, leading to disinterest among young people in continuing the work of village Party organizations with weak leadership.	However, it has also led to the emergence of various levels of "hollowization" in the countryside, especially the weakening of the rural grassroots organization. The secretary of the village party branch and the party members display the characteristics of "old age and low education," namely, age, low education, and the leadership of the village party organization is not strong, and the problem	But objectively also led to rural "hollowing out" in different degrees, especially the weakening of rural grassroots organizations, village Party branch secretary and party members showed "one old one low" characteristics, namely aging, low education, village Party organization leaders team is not strong, yellow and yellow problem prominent.
如果乡村人才等要素一直单向流往城市，乡村长期处于“失血” “贫血”状态，振兴就是一句空话。	If rural talent and other assets only flow in one direction, to the cities, in the long term this leads to “loss of blood” and “anemia” in rural areas, in turn making “revitalization” an empty slogan.	If the village talent and other factors have been going one way to the city, the village is in a state of "blood loss" and "anemia" for a long time,	If elements such as rural talents have been flowing to cities in one direction, and the countryside has been in a state of "blood loss" and "anaemia" for a long time
把那些有能力、有觉悟、有志于为家乡服务的农民工吸引回来，引导他们返乡创业成为致富带头人，从中择优培养成党员、乡村干部，充实基层干部队伍，这是解决农村党员队伍和基层党组织青黄不接的治本之策。	Attracting back migrant workers who are capable, conscientious, and determined to serve their hometowns, incentivizing them to return there to start businesses and become wealth creators, and then cultivating them as Party members and rural cadres to enrich the ranks of grassroots cadres is a permanent solution to the problem of young people not continuing the work of rural Party corps and grassroots Party organizations.	To attract back migrant workers who have the ability, awareness and desire to serve their hometowns, guide them to return to their hometowns and start their own businesses to become rich leaders. From there, they will be trained to become party members, rural cadres and grassroots cadres. This is a solution to the root causes of rural party members and grassroots party organizations.	Attract those who are capable, conscious and interested in serving their hometown migrant workers back, guide them to return home and start businesses to become rich leaders, choose from merit training into party members and rural cadres, enrich the grassroots cadres, which is to solve the root causes of rural Party members and grassroots Party organizations.
优秀农民工引得回，还要让他们留得住、干得好。	Once outstanding rural migrant workers return, they also must be convinced to stay and do good work.	The good migrant workers are brought back, and they must stay and do well.	Good migrant workers are brought back, and they need to stay and do well.
近年来，四川从狠抓农民工党建入手，在严格人选标准的基础上，建立优秀农民工定向回引、服务保障、培训提能、选拔使用等制度机制，让他们在能力上有提升、工作上有保障、生活上有盼头，真正在农村扎下根，干事创业有成就感。	In recent years, Sichuan has focused more on Party-building among rural migrant workers, and on the basis of strict selection requirements, has established systems and mechanisms such as directed incentives for outstanding rural migrant workers to return, service guarantees, training and promotion, and selection and use which ensure they will gain from their effort, receive guarantees in their work, have things to look forward to in life, truly put down roots in the village, and feel a sense of accomplishment in their work and entrepreneurship.	In recent years, Sichuan has started from the construction of the Peasant Workers Party to establish institutional mechanisms such as orientation introduction, service guarantee, training, and selection and use of outstanding rural workers on the basis of strict selection criteria, so that they can enhance their ability, work security and life skills, take root in the countryside and have a real sense of achievement among officers.	In recent years, Sichuan began by paying close attention to the Party building of migrant workers. On the basis of strict selection criteria, Sichuan has established institutional mechanisms such as oriented referral, service guarantee, training, selection and use of outstanding migrant workers, so that they can improve their ability, secure their jobs, and look forward to their lives.
今年是决战脱贫攻坚的收官之年，做好脱贫攻坚与乡村振兴的衔接，人才是关键因素。	This is the final year of the battle to decisively end poverty, and talent is the key factor to establish the connection between poverty alleviation and rural revitalization.	This year is the end of the battle to fight poverty, to do a good job of fighting poverty and rural revitalization, talent is the key factor.	This year is the end of the decisive fight against poverty, do a good job of poverty alleviation and rural revitalization of the link, talent is the key factor.
各级党委政府要高度重视优秀返乡农民工这一群体，通过综合措施，把他们打造成一支留得住、能战斗、带不走的工作队、生力军，为农村脱贫奔小康和发展振兴提供强有力的组织保障和人才支撑。	Party committees and governments at every level should prioritize rural migrant workers who return to their hometowns, and should use comprehensive measures to form them into a work corps and army that is willing to stay, capable of contributing, and unwilling to leave, so that they can serve as a powerful organizational guarantee and talent pool that supports rural poverty elimination and prosperity building efforts, as well as rural development and revitalization.	The Party committee and government at all levels should attach great importance to the group of good returning rural migrant workers, and adopt comprehensive measures to make them a retention, combatable, non-removable task force and force, so as to provide strong organizational security and talent support for rural poverty alleviation and development and revitalization.	Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to this group of outstanding returning migrant workers and, through comprehensive measures, build them into a task force and new force that can stay, fight and cannot leave, providing strong organizational guarantees and talent support for rural poverty alleviation and development and revitalization.

For example, we built a bridge within the tunnel that was 24 meters in length across a karst cave gap that was 10 meters wide and 55 meters deep to avoid tunnel settlement,” he said.	"During the construction of the project, we have adopted advanced geological forecasting methods such as geological survey, physical exploration and advanced drilling methods. We have adopted special design solutions for more than 30 types of caves.

□ 本报通讯员 赵一凡	Reported by, Zhao Yifan	Correspondent Zhao Yifan	Correspondent Zhao Yifan
3岁的小文在某大学操场玩耍时，意外被垒球队的陈某在投球时砸中了头部。	When playing on sports ground of an university, 3-year old Xiaowen was accidentally hit in the head by a softball thrown by Chen from the softball team.	The 3-year-old was playing in a college playground when he was accidentally hit in the head by a softball team's Chen while pitching.	Three-year-old Xiaowen was accidentally hit in the head by Chen of the softball team while playing in a college playground.
陈某赔偿后，小文的父亲文先生作为小文的法定代理人将学校诉至法院，要求事发操场所在的学校赔礼道歉，并支付医疗费、精神损害抚慰金等共计两万元。	After being compensated by Chen for the accident, Xiaowen’s father, acting as Xiaowen’s legal guardian, sued the university in court, demanding an apology for what happened on the sports ground and a total of 20,000 yuan for medical bills and emotional distress.	As a result of the settlement of the case, the court ordered the school to pay compensation to the school where the incident took place, and to pay medical expenses and compensation for moral damages totalling 20,000 yuan.	After Chen compensation, Mr. Wen Xiaowen's father, Mr. Wen Xiaowen, as Xiaowen's legal representative, brought the school to the court, demanding that the school where the playground occurred apologize, and pay medical expenses, moral damage relief and a total of 20,000 yuan.
近日，北京市海淀区人民法院对此案审理后认为，事发时学校在操场设置了防护网，已尽到适当的安全保障义务，且陈某已进行了赔偿，据此判决驳回了原告的诉讼请求。	Recently, the People’s Court of Haidian District in Beijing heard the case and believed the university fulfilled its obligation to provide appropriate safety assurance by setting up a protective barrier at the sports ground; in addition, Chen had already compensated for the accident, and therefore, the claims of the plaintiff were dismissed.	Recently, after hearing the case, the Beijing Haidian District People's Court held that the school had installed a protective net in the playground at the time of the incident, that it had done its proper safety and security obligations, and that Chen had made compensation, and accordingly rejected the plaintiff's claim.	Recently, Beijing Haidian District People's Court after hearing the case believes that the school set up a protective net in the playground when the incident occurred, has done the appropriate security obligations, and Chen has made compensation, according to which the judgment rejected the plaintiff's claim.
文先生诉称，2019年暑假期间，他带小文在学校操场玩耍，当时正值垒球队在操场训练。	As Mr. Wen claims, he took Xiaowen to the sports ground of the university during summer vacation in 2019, and the softball team was training on the sports ground at the same time.	Mr. Wen claims that during the summer of 2019, he took Xiao Wen to play in the school playground while the softball team was training in the playground.	Mr. Wen claims that during the summer vacation of 2019, he took Xiaowen to play in the school playground while the softball team was training in the playground.
为了规避由此带来的风险，小文、文先生和其他众多小朋友及家长在垒球队指定的安全区域内活动。	To avoid potential risks, Xiaowen and Mr. Wen and other parents and children were playing in a safety area designated by the softball team.	In order to avoid the risks associated with this, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents operate in a safe area designated by the softball team.	In order to avoid this risk, Mr. Xiao Wen, Mr. Wen Wen Wen and many other children and parents operate in the softball team designated safe area.
但之后垒球队队员陈某在投球时脱手，导致垒球越过护网飞至上述安全区域内并击中小文后脑。	However, later when Chen, a member of the softball team, was throwing the ball, it slipped out of his hand, went over the protective barrier into the safety area, and hit Xiaowen in the back of her head.	However, the player was then thrown off the pitch, causing the ball to fly over the guard net and hit the back of the head.	However, Chen, a member of the softball team, got off his hands while pitching, causing the softball to fly across the net into the above safe area and hit Xiaowen in the back of the
文先生立即带小文去医院治疗，被诊断为头外伤。	Mr. Wen took Xiaowen to the hospital immediately, and she was diagnosed as having head trauma.	Mr Wen immediately took Xiao Wen to hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with a head trauma.	Mr Wen immediately took Xiaowen to hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with head trauma.
文先生认为，学校球场的设施不符合相关安全规定，未对球队及相关设施进行有效管理。	Mr. Wen believes the sports field facilities are not in line with safety regulations and the university failed to effectively manage the softball team and relevant facilities.	Mr Wen argued that the facilities on the school pitch did not comply with relevant safety regulations and did not effectively manage the team and associated facilities.	According to Mr. Wen, the facilities of the school stadium did not meet the relevant safety regulations and did not effectively manage the team and related facilities.
学校的过失导致上述事件发生，导致小文身心遭受巨大的痛苦，同时也给其家人带来了较大的痛苦，对此学校应当承担法律责任。	It was negligence of the university that led to the incident, which caused physical and mental distress for Xiaowen and her family, hence the university should take legal responsibility.	The failure of the school resulted in the incident, which caused considerable physical and psychological suffering to the boy and his family, for which the school should be held legally liable.	The fault of the school caused the above incident, which caused Xiaowen to suffer great physical and mental suffering, but also caused greater suffering to his family, for which the school should bear legal responsibility.
对此，校方辩称，学校已经在操场设置了防护网，并张贴了管理规定、训练通知，告知进入操场须与训练场地保持安全距离并提醒注意自身安全，原告也不能证明学校“未尽到安全保障义务”，所以不同意赔偿。	Against these accusations, the university argued that it has set up protective barrier around the sports field and posted management regulations and training notices informing people to keep a safe distance from the training field when entering the sports ground and to be aware of their personal safety, and because the plaintiff couldn’t prove the university “didn’t fulfill safety assurance obligations”, the university refused to pay compensation.	In response, the school argued that the school had installed protective netting in the playground, and posted management regulations, training notices, told the playground to keep a safe distance from the training site and warned of its own safety, and that the plaintiffs could not prove that the school "did not meet its safety and security obligations," so they	In response, the school argued that the school had set up protective nets in the playground and posted regulations and training notices telling it to keep a safe distance from the playground and remind it of its own safety, and that the plaintiffs could not prove that the school had "failed in its safety and security obligations" and therefore did not agree to compensation.
法院审理后认为，事发的场地系涉案大学对公众免费开放的场地，学校虽对操场的管理存在安全保障义务，但这种安全保障义务仅需达到一般的注意义务即可。	After hearing the case, the court believed the venue where the incident took place is open to public for free, and though the university bears safety assurance obligations for the sports ground, the extent of its obligations were merely to have general notices.	The court heard that the site of the incident was a site open to the public by the university in question and that, although the school had a duty of safety and security with respect to the management of the playground, this duty of safety and security should only be met	After the hearing, the Court held that the site was open to the public free of charge by the university concerned, and that although the school had a duty of security in relation to the management of the playground, that duty of security was sufficient only to meet the general duty
事发时学校在操场设置了防护网，已经尽到了适当的安全保障义务，且陈某也按照此前达成的赔偿协议向小文赔偿了医疗费、交通费等各项损失两千余元，双方约定此次纠纷一次性解决。	When the incident took place, there was a protective barrier set up by the university on the sports ground, meaning the appropriate safety assurance obligations were fulfilled, and Chen paid over 2,000 yuan in compensation for Xiaowen’s medical bill, transportation, and other losses according to the compensation agreement reached, so the two parities agreed to settle their dispute once and for all.	At the time of the incident, the school installed a protective net in the playground, and has done its proper safety and security obligations, and Chen has also compensated Xiaowen for medical expenses, transportation costs and other losses of more than 2,000 yuan according to a previous compensation agreement.	At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective net in the playground, has done the appropriate security obligations, and Chen also in accordance with the compensation agreement reached earlier to Xiaowen compensation for medical expenses, transportation costs and other losses of more than two thousand yuan, the two sides agreed to
事后，小文家长再次主张学校赔偿，于法无据，法院判决驳回了原告的全部诉请。	Afterwards, Xiaowen’s parents’ claims for compensation from the university was found to be groundless, and the court ruled to dismiss all claims of the plaintiff.	Afterwards, the parents again sought compensation from the school, which was unfounded, and the court ruled against the plaintiffs.	Afterwards, Xiaowen's parents again claimed compensation from the school, and the court decision dismissed all of the plaintiffs' claims.
宣判后，双方均未上诉，该判决现已生效。	After neither party decided to appeal, the verdict became effective.	Neither party appealed the judgement, which is now in force.	Following the sentence, neither party appealed and the sentence has now entered into force.
根据我国侵权责任法第37条规定，学校作为公共场所的管理人，负有安全保障义务；在第三人的行为造成他人损害的情况下，第三人承担侵权责任，而未尽到安全保障义务的公共场所管理人应当承担相应的补充责任。	According to Article 37 of Tort Liability Law, as the manager of a public place, the university bears safety assurance obligations; and when actions of a third party cause damages to others, the third party takes tort liability, while manager of the public place that fails to fulfill safety assurance obligations takes complementary liabilities.	According to article 37 of our tort liability law, schools, as managers of public places, have safety and security obligations; in the case of damage caused by the actions of a third person, the third person is liable for infringement, and the manager of a public place who does not meet the safety and security obligations should	According to Article 37 of China's Tort Liability Law, schools, as managers of public places, have the obligation to ensure safety; in the case of damage caused to others by the acts of third parties, third parties bear tort liability, while public place managers who fail to meet the obligation of security shall bear corresponding supplementary responsibilities.
法官称，由于作为公共场所的管理人，最有可能了解整个场所的实际情况、预见可能发生的危险和损害，从而最有可能采取必要措施防止损失的发生或者减轻损害的程度，且避免和减轻损害发生的成本最低，故而法律规定由其承担从事社会活动相应的保障义务。	The judge stated that because manager of the public place is the party most likely to know the actual state of the site, and to foresee potential dangers and harms, it is the most likely party to take necessary measures to prevent losses from happening or reduce damages and to keep the cost of damage prevention or reduction to a minimum, meaning the law requires it to bear the appropriate safety assurance obligations when engaging in social activities.	According to the judge, since, as the manager of a public place, it is most likely to know the actual situation in the place as a whole, to anticipate the danger and damage that may occur, to take the necessary measures to prevent loss or to mitigate the extent of the damage, and to avoid and mitigate the least cost of the damage, the law	According to the judge, since, as the administrator of a public place, it is most likely to know the actual situation of the place as a whole, to anticipate the danger and damage that may occur, and thus to take the necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of loss or mitigate the extent of damage, and to avoid and mitigate the damage at the lowest cost, the
本案中，对于向公众免费开放的操场中不特定的进入人群，学校所负的安全保障义务应与其从事的社会活动相适应，具体而言，主要是应采取基本的安全措施并对于隐蔽性危险负有告知义务。	In this case, for the non-specific group of people entering the sports ground open to public for free, the school’s safety assurance obligation were in line with the social activities it was engaged in, specifically which were primarily to take basic safety measures and to inform people of hidden dangers.	In the present case, the safety and security obligations of the school should be commensurate with its social activities, in particular the obligation to take basic security measures and to inform of hidden dangers, in respect of the non-specific access to the playground, which is open to the public free of charge.	In this case, the school's obligation to ensure safety for unspecified persons entering a playground open to the public free of charge should be commensurate with its social activities, in particular basic safety measures and an obligation to inform of hidden dangers.
司法实践中，也不宜对公共场所管理人苛以过高的安全保障义务。	In juridical practice, it’s not advised to make safety assurance obligations too high or too strict for the managers of public places.	In judicial practice, it is also inappropriate to impose excessive safety and security obligations on managers of public places.	In judicial practice, it is not appropriate to impose excessive security obligations on managers of public places.
如果学校已经采取了设置防护网且尽到告知义务，则可以认定学校不具有过错，不应承担法律责任。	If the university has set up a protective barrier and fulfilled its duty to inform, the university is considered not at fault and does not bear legal responsibility.	If the school has put in place a protective net and has a duty to inform, the school may be found not to be at fault and not liable.	If the school has adopted protective nets and has fulfilled its duty to inform, it can be found that the school is not at fault and should not be held liable.
此外，对于第三人侵权，即使学校等公共场所的管理者未尽到安全保障义务，其承担的责任也是作为一种损害赔偿的补充，根据最新颁布的民法典，管理者承担补充责任后，还可以向第三人追偿。	Furthermore, as to third party tort, even if the manager of public places such as a university doesn’t fulfill its safety assurance obligations, its liability is complementary to damage compensation; according to the new Civil Code, the manager can claim compensation from the third party after assuming complementary liability.	In addition, the liability of the superintendent of a public place, such as a school, is supplemental to the liability of a third person for damages, even if the superintendent of a public place, such as a school, fails to comply with the obligation of safety and security. Under the	In addition, in cases of infringement by third parties, the liability of managers of public places such as schools, even if they fail to meet their safety and security obligations, is supplemented by damages. According to the recently enacted Civil Code, managers can also recover compensation from third parties after assuming additional liability.
故在此类事故中，受害者在已经收到直接侵权人的赔偿后，不应再扩大求偿范围。	Therefore, the victim must not expand the scope of the claim after receiving compensation from the directly liable party in this kind of accident.	In such cases, the victim should therefore not have to extend the scope of the claim after having received compensation from the direct infringer.	Therefore, in such accidents, the victim should not extend the scope of his claim after he has received compensation from the direct infringer.

Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for sports and fitness increased.

以“谍战剧”为观众熟知的演员柳云龙在剧中突破形象，挑战了一位颇具喜感的“口吃特工”。	Liu Yunlong, an actor well-known for his spy TV series, has made a breakthrough new work of art, acting as a “stuttering service agent” who is comical, which is soon to be broadcast.

Liu Yunlong, an actor known to viewers as "spy drama," broke through his image in the play, challenging a happy "stuttering agent."
近几年，《伪装者》《面具》《风筝》等剧的走红，都证明着谍战类型剧有着旺盛的生命力。	In recent years, the popularity of TV series including Pretender, Mask, and Kite proves the great appeal of spy TV series.	In recent years, the popularity of such dramas as "The Camouflage," "The Mask," and "The Kite" has demonstrated the vitality of espionage-type dramas.	In recent years, the popularity of such dramas as "The Disguise," "The Mask," and "The Kite" proves that espionage dramas have strong vitality.
不同于以往的谍战作品，《胜算》放眼世界，将故事背景外延至苏联远东战场。	Different from previous spy TV series, The Possibility of Victory takes a global view, extending its context to Far Eastern battlefield in the Soviet Union.	Unlike in the past, the story is set in the far east of the Soviet Union.	Unlike previous espionage films, Victory takes a global perspective, extending the story to the Soviet Far East.
它以1944年抗日战争最后阶段为背景，讲述了中共秘密情报工作人员唐飞（柳云龙饰），在中国地下党林河省委书记和苏联远东情报局局长的领导下，执行苏军远东情报局的“穆丹乌拉”谋略行动的故事。	It is based in the final stage of the Resistance War against the Japanese invasion in 1944, and tells the story about Tang Fei (played by Liu Yunlong), a secret agent of the Communist Party of China, who, led by Communist Party’s President of Linhe Province and Director of Far Eastern Information Bureau of Soviet Union, executes the Soviet Union’s “Mudanura” strategic plan.	It tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), a secret intelligence officer of the Communist Party of China (CCP), who, under the leadership of the secretary of the Linhe Party of China and the director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency, carries out the "Mutanullah" strategy of the Soviet Army Far East	Set in the final stages of the Sino-Japanese War of 1944, it tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), a secret CCP intelligence worker who, under the leadership of Linhe Provincial Party Secretary of the Chinese Underground Party and the head of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Service, carries out the strategic operation "Mudan
不少谍战剧中，男主角作为高级间谍，一出场就是帅气、高智商、成熟的完美形象。	In many spy TV series, the heroes are all impeccably handsome and mature super spies with superb IQ’s when they first appear on screen.	Many of the characters are high-class spies, and they play the role of handsome, high IQ and mature perfectly.	In many espionage dramas, the main character as a senior spy, one appearance is handsome, high IQ, mature perfect image.
但在柳云龙看来，这样的人并不适合做间谍，“间谍应该是那种放人堆儿里根本找不着的人，如果一出场就是那种很装很帅的形象，恨不得所有人都要注意你，还能潜伏吗？《风筝》里有一句台词，‘你不来抓我，我都忘记自己是个国民党了’，间谍要去精英化。”	But in the opinion of Liu Yunlong, such people are not suitable to be spies, “Spies should be someone who won’t be recognized in the mass, and if he or she appears cool or handsome at first glance, he or she will attract nearly all the attention, so how can he or she hide in the enemy’s camp? There is a line in Kite, “If you hadn’t caught me, I would have nearly forgetten my identity as a member of Nationalist Party of China”, which shows how spies should not be presented as elites. ”	But in Liu Yunlong's view, such a person is not suitable for spying. "Spy should be the kind of person who can not find it in the heap of people. If it is a very handsome image, it is not necessary for everyone to pay attention to you. Can it be lurking? There is a line in" Kite, "'you don't catch me, I forget that I'm a Kuomintang," and the spy is going to be elitist.	But in Liu Yunlong's view, such a person is not suitable for spying. "Spies should be the kind of people who can't be found in the pile. If the appearance is the kind of very handsome image. I hope everyone should pay attention to you. Can they still lurk?" Kite "has a line," You don't come to arrest me. I forget that I am a Kuomintang. "
所以在《胜算》中，柳云龙别出心裁地将他饰演的主人公唐飞设计成一个带有喜感的“口吃特工”。	Therefore, in The Possibility of Victory, Liu Yunlong’s original idea was to design the hero Tang Fei as a comical “stuttering secret agent”.	In the film, the protagonist is portrayed as a "stuttering agent."	So in "Winning odds," Liu Yunlong ingeniously designed his protagonist, Tang Fei, as a "stuttering agent" with joy.
《胜算》中的另一方阵营，是由梁冠华饰演的日本人福原和李立群饰演的警察厅厅长方世宝合力撑起来的。	The “enemy” camp in The Possibility of Victory, is led by the Japanese Fukuwara, played by Liang Guanhua, and Director of the Police Fang Shibao, played by Li Liqun.	On the other side of the spectrum is the police chief Fang Shibao, played by Liang Guanhua as Fukuhara and Li Li Liqun as Fukuhara.	The other side of the story is supported by the Japanese Fukuhara played by Leung Guan-hua and the police chief Fang Sebo played by Li Liqun.
一南一北两位实力派戏骨，为整部剧增添了许多高手过招的看点。	These two skilled actors, one of whom comes from Northern China and the other from Southern China, invigorate multiple wonderful scenes in the TV series.	The first two episodes of the series have a great deal of interest in the entire series.	There are a lot of people in the world, and there are a lot of people in the world.
导演殷飞用“飙戏”一词形容剧中李立群与柳云龙的对手戏，“绝对是飙戏，他们二位特别默契，他们身上的这种默契对我来讲非常有冲击力。很多时候他们的戏都是‘现挂’的，例如我们只写了半页纸的长度，拍摄时我不喊停，他俩就能一直演下去。”	The director Yin Fei describes the performance of Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong as “an acting battle”, “It was definitely a battle, they coordinated very well with each other, which was very moving for me. At many times, their performance was “improvised”, for instance, the script was only half a page, but without my disruption, they would continue their performance. ”	Director Yao Fei used the term "soaring opera" to describe the play of Li Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong's rival drama. "Definitely the soaring opera, their two special tacit agreement, they have a great influence on me. A lot of times their plays are 'hanging"; for example, we only write half a page of paper length, I don't shout when shooting, they can play all the time. "	Director Cao Fei used the term "drag play" to describe Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong's rival play. "Absolutely drag play, they two particularly tacit understanding, this kind of understanding on them is very impactful to me. Many times their play is' hang now," for example, we only write half the length of the page, I don't stop shooting, they can continue to perform. "
高手之间互不抢戏，导演也不去搅戏，当演员都在角色之中并保证自己人物状态的时候，不仅可以从人物角度出发去塑造角色，还能给观众带来更多的观看可能性，殷飞说这样的戏才够出彩。	Masters don’t steal the show from others, and directors never disrupt a performance; all the actors were immersed in the characters, allowing them to not only craft the roles from the perspective of their characters, but also create more possibilities for the audience, and Yin Fei praised such performances as marvelous.	When the actors are in the characters and guarantee the status of their characters, they can not only shape the characters from the perspective of the characters, but also bring more viewing possibilities to the audience.	When the actors are in the role and ensure their character status, they can not only shape the role from the perspective of the characters, but also bring more possibilities to the audience. Cao Fei said such plays are good enough.
剧中，还能看到许多“柳氏谍战剧”中熟悉的面庞，《风筝》中名震一时、威风凛凛的“山城F4”，在《胜算》中也聚齐了三位。	In the TV series, many familiar faces from “Liu’s spy TV series” can also be seen; for instance, three actors from the popular and influential “Mountain Town F4” in Kite have roles in The Possibility of Victory.

据导演大鹏介绍 ，《吉祥如意》的创作源自“一场天意 ” ， 拍摄期间家庭突如其来的一系列变故，让原本的拍摄计划不得不随之改变，没有剧本的生活最终被记录成电影，却释放出超越设计的张力。	According to Da Peng, inspiration came from “accidents”, a series of family accidents during production, which changed the original production plan; the use of real-life performances without scripts was finally recorded as a film, creating a film far different from what he originally imagined.	According to director Yoshinori Ohsumi, the production was inspired by "A God Wanted," and the family's sudden series of events during filming forced the original filming plan to be changed, with life without a script eventually being recorded into a film, freeing up tension that went beyond design.	According to director Dapeng, the creation of "Auspicious" originated from "a divine intention." During the shooting period, the family suddenly changed a series of changes, so that the original shooting plan had to be changed, life without a script ended up being recorded as a film, but released tension beyond design.
导演大鹏究竟如何面对这场“天意 ” ， 又该如何继续迎接这场天意带来的种种改变呢？	How did Da Peng face these “accidents”, and how did he embrace the changes brought about by the “accidents”?	How does the director, Ohsuka, face this "heavenly purpose," and how to continue to embrace the changes brought about by this heavenly purpose?	How does director Dapeng face this "Providence," and how should he continue to meet the changes brought about by this Providence?
毫无疑问《吉祥如意》是充满实验性的，几乎全素人的阵容和创新的视听风格将镜头前的生活变成了一部电影，在真实影像的包裹下，观众也会从影片所呈现的家庭中找到自己和家人的影子，随着影片中这场家庭聚会的落幕，唤起一系列思考。	There is no doubt that The Reunions is fully experimental: none of the cast are professionally trained, and the audiovisual style is quite creative, which transforms life into a movie, and composed of real-life videos, the audience will certainly find someone like themselves and their family, so that at the end of the film, it inspires deep thoughts.	There is no doubt that "auspicious" is full of experimental, almost all-you-can-eat lineup and innovative audio-visual style to turn life in front of the camera into a movie. Under the cover of real footage, the audience will also find themselves and their families from the home presented in the film, and evoke a series of thoughts as the family gathering	There is no doubt that "Good Luck" is full of experimentation, the almost amateur lineup and innovative audio-visual style turns life in front of the camera into a film, wrapped in real images, viewers will also find their own and family shadows from the family presented in the film, as the family gathering in the film ends, evoke a series of thoughts.

志愿填报前 先弄懂啥是专业级差	Understanding university major point deductions before choosing your preferred majors	Before voluntarily filling in the report, it is a professional grade difference.	Know before volunteering Is professional grade difference
每年填报高考志愿，都有学生或者家长因为对于志愿填报中涉及的名词不了解，进而影响志愿填报。	Each year, when we fill out our preferred majors on the NCEE (National College Entrance Examination), there are always students and parents who don’t understand the terminology involved, which can directly affect how you select your preferred majors.	Each year, students or parents who do not know the terms involved in the voluntary entry will be asked to volunteer.	Every year, there are students or parents who do not understand the terms involved in the volunteer registration, which can affect the volunteer registration.
今年，北京交通大学、北京科技大学、北京邮电大学、北京林业大学、北京化工大学5所高校联合发布2020年招生政策，取消专业级差。	This year, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University, and Beijing University of Chemical Technology issued a joint admissions policy for 2020 which eliminates major point deductions.

专业级差是什么意思，在志愿填报中有何重要意义？	What are “major point deductions”, and how do they impact your choice of major?	What does it mean to be professional and what is the significance of volunteering?	What does professional grade mean and what is important in volunteering?
专业分配规则有三种方式	The three methods of major allocation	Professional allocation rules in three ways	There are three ways to assign specialization rules
专家提醒，填报志愿前，一定要详读心仪学校的《招生章程》，了解高校的录取规则，包括调档比例，专业分配规则等。	Experts say that before filling out your preferred majors, you should carefully read the school’s “Admissions Guidelines” to learn about the college’s admissions regulations, including enrollment ratios, major allocation, and so on.	Experts remind that before filling in the volunteer, be sure to read the admissions charter of your favorite school in detail, and understand the admission rules of colleges and universities, including transfer rates and professional allocation rules.	Experts remind that before filling in the volunteer, be sure to read the admissions charter of your favorite school, understand the admission rules of universities, including transfer ratio, professional allocation rules and so on.
专业分配规则，是指高校调档之后，对于专业录取主要有专业优先、分数优先、专业级差三种方式。	Major allocation refers to the three primary methods of admitting students to particular majors, which are major priority, score priority, and major point deductions, after a student enrolls at a university.	Professional allocation rules, refers to the college transfer, for professional admission mainly have professional priority, grade priority, professional grade difference three ways.	Major allocation rules, refers to the college transfer, there are major priority, score priority, professional grade difference three ways of admission.
高校具体使用哪一种方式，会在《招生章程》中明确。	The specific method used by a particular university will be stated clearly in the “Admissions Guidelines”.	In particular, it is stated in the Charter of Admission.	The specific method used by universities will be specified in the Admissions Charter.
但也有一些高校的录取原则是总分优先，专业之间没有级差。	However, some universities use balanced prioritization, and do not apply point deductions for different majors.	However, there are also a number of higher education institutions that have an overall score of plus or minus.	However, there are also some universities where the admission principle is total priority and there is no grade difference between majors.
就是说将录取范围内考生按照总分排队，当分数未达到第一专业志愿录取分数线时，则看是否达到了第二专业志愿录取分数线，以此类推直到录取到最后一个专业志愿，各专业志愿之间不设级差。	This means that all students who qualify for enrollment are ordered by a balanced total score, and if their score falls below enrollment requirements for their first preferred major, the university looks at whether the student qualifies for the second preferred major, and so on until the student’s final preferred major, none of which involves point deductions for any major.	This means that when the score does not meet the voluntary entry score line for the first major, the entry score line for the second major is met, and so forth.	In other words, candidates within the scope of admission will be lined up according to the total score, when the score does not reach the first major volunteer admission score line, then see whether the second major volunteer admission score line is reached, and so on until the admission to the last major volunteer, there is no grade difference between
所谓“专业级差”，是院校在安排考生专业时，按招生章程中公布的一个或几个分数值，来确定选报不同专业志愿考生的录取专业，这种分数值就是“专业级差”。	“Major point deductions”, as they are called, are when universities apply one or several values calculated through a formula published in the “Admission Guidelines” to determine a student’s admission in a particular selected major; this value is called a “major point deductions”.	The so-called "professional grade difference" is the number of points announced in the admissions charter to determine the number of students selected to volunteer in different majors, which is the "professional grade difference."	The so-called "professional grade difference" is when universities arrange candidates for major, according to the admission charter published one or several score values, to determine the selection of different professional volunteer candidates for admission major, this score value is "professional grade difference."
也就是院校在录取考生第一专业志愿和非第一专业志愿时的分数差额，各专业志愿间级差分数，如3分、2分、1分等。	This refers to the point deduction that occurs between the student’s preferred major and another major, expressed by a point value, such as 3 points, 2 points, or 1 point.	The difference is the difference between the scores of the first professional volunteer and the non-first professional volunteer, the difference between the scores of each professional volunteer, such as 3, 2 and 1.	That is, the difference in the score between the first professional volunteer and the first professional volunteer, the difference between the professional volunteer scores, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point.
举例来说。	Consider this example:	Take, for example.	For example.
假设学生小明报考A高校，考了560分，其专业志愿分别为：计算机、国际贸易、自动化、机械工程、电子商务，A高校的专业录取实行专业级差的办法，级差分为2分、1分、1分、0分。	Xiaoming, a student, applies to University A with an NCEE score of 560 and major preferences listed in this order: Computing, International Trade, Automation, Mechanical Engineering, and E-commerce, after which University A applies major point deductions of 2, 1, 1, and 0 points.	Assuming that students apply to A university, they have 560 points. Their professional volunteers are: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce, and the professional admission of A university has a professional grade difference method. The difference is divided into 2 points, 1 point, 1 point and 0 points.	Assuming that the student Xiao Ming applied for the A college and took the exam with 560 points, their professional volunteers were: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce. The professional grade difference is divided into 2 points, 1 point, 1 point and 0 points.
在进行专业分配时，如果小明的第一专业志愿符合专业录取要求且专业有计划余额，那么小明被录取到“计算机”专业；若计算机未被录取，则他的分数将会被减去2分，按558分的成绩同第一专业志愿报考“国际贸易”的考生排序，确定是否符合专业录取条件；倘若仍不能满足，分数再减去1分(即557分)进行第三专业志愿“自动化”的录取；若依旧不能满足，分数再被减去1分(即556分)进行第四专业的录取，后续专业如果仍不能满足其专业志愿，将不再减分，以此类推。	When allocating majors, if Xiaoming meets the admission requirements for his first preferred major of Computing and the major has remaining vacancies, he is admitted to the Computing major; if he is not admitted to the Computing major, he is considered for his second preferred major of International Trade with 2 points deducted from his NCEE score, at 558, and his qualifications are considered for that major; if he again fails to qualify, 1 point is deducted (for a total of 557), and he is considered for his third preferred major; if he further fails to qualify, 1 more point is deducted (for a total of 556), and his qualifications are considered for his fourth preferred major, and if he fails to qualify this time, no points are deducted when he is considered for his fifth preferred major, and so on.	In the case of a professional assignment, if the first professional volunteer of Xiaoming meets the professional admission requirements and the professional has a planned balance, Xiaoming is admitted to the "computer" major; if the computer is not accepted, his score will be subtracted by 2 points, ranked according to the score of 558 points with the first professional volunteer registration "international trade" test, to determine whether the professional admission requirements are met; if it is still not satisfied, the score is subtracted by 1 point (or 557 points) for the third professional voluntary "automatic" admission; if it is still not satisfied, the score is subtracted by 1 point (or 556 points) for the fourth professional admission, and if the subsequent professional is not satisfied	At the time of major assignment, if Xiao Ming's first professional volunteer meets the requirements for professional admission and the major has a planned balance, then Xiao Ming is admitted to the "computer" major; if the computer is not accepted, his score will be subtracted by 2 points, according to the score of 558 points with the first professional volunteer candidate for "international trade," to determine whether they meet the requirements for professional admission; if still not met, the score is subtracted by 1 point (i.e. 557 points) for the third professional volunteer "automated" admission; if still not met, the score is subtracted by 1 point (i.e. 556 points) for admission to the fourth major, if the subsequent major still does not meet its professional
不同大学专业级差设置不同	Different universities have different point deductions	Different University Professional Grades Set Differently	Different university level settings
随着平行志愿的普及，现在很多高校都已经取消了专业级差，但今年仍有部分高校还保留了这一方法，从各校公布的《招生章程》来看，今年主要有20多所大学设置了专业级差。	As balanced major preferences become more popular, many universities have already stopped using major point deductions, but some universities still use this method, and from the “Admissions Guidelines” published by each school, we know that this year, major point deductions are applied at over 20 universities.	With the introduction of parallel volunteerism, many universities have now abolished the professional grade difference, but some universities have retained the method this year. From the "admissions charter" published by the universities, more than 20 universities have set professional grade difference this year.	With the popularity of parallel volunteerism, many universities have now abolished the professional grade difference, but this year some universities still retain this method, from the university announced the "Admission Charter," this year, mainly more than 20 universities set professional grade difference.
比如，四川农业大学、山东科技大学、黑龙江中医药大学、江苏科技大学、江西师范大学、成都医学院、东北电力大学、集美大学、南京医科大学、南京工业大学、宁夏大学、山东理工大学、中国民用航空飞行学院等。	These include Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing Tech University, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, and Civil Aviation Flight University of China.	For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology	For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology
在这些高校中，每所大学设置的专业级差都不一样。	The major point deduction values applied at each of these universities are different.	At each of these universities, the difference in professional level is different.	Each of these universities has different levels of specialization.
有的高校在每个专业都设有级差，比如宁夏大学，档案已投到该校的考生，根据考生填报专业志愿的顺序依次递减1分后按分数排序录取。	Some apply the same point deductions to every major, such as Ningxia University, where an applicant can expect to find 1 point deducted for each major in the order of major preference.	Some universities have a grade difference in each major, such as Ningxia University, and the files have been sent to the students of the school, and the students are ranked according to the number of points in the order in which they file their professional volunteers.	Some universities have grade differences in each major, such as Ningxia University, files have been sent to the candidates at the school, according to the order in which candidates fill out their professional volunteer, decreasing by 1 point and then sorted by score.
而有的大学在不同的专业之间，设置了不同的专业级差。	Other universities use different fixed point values for different universities.	And there are universities that set different professional grades between different majors.	And some universities set different grades between different majors.
比如集美大学，专业志愿级差总分值为4分，即第一专业志愿与其他专业志愿级差为3分，其他专业志愿间不设级差，视为平行志愿，其他专业志愿与调剂专业志愿间专业级差为1分。	Jimei University, for example, applies a total deduction of 4 points, meaning there is a difference of 3 points between a student’s first preferred major and other preferred majors, among preferred majors after the first there is no further deduction by preference (meaning they receive equal deductions), and there is a 1 point difference between preferred majors after the first and non-preferred majors.	For example, at Jimei University, the total difference between professional volunteer level is 4 points, that is, the difference between first professional volunteer and other professional volunteer level is 3 points.	For example, Jimei University, the total score of professional volunteer grade difference is 4 points, that is, the first professional volunteer and other professional volunteer grade difference is 3 points, there is no grade difference between other professional volunteers, considered as parallel volunteer, other professional volunteer and conditioning professional volunteer grade difference is 1 point.
填报志愿时，考生及家长一定要认真阅读所报学校的录取政策，看看有没有专业级差，级差的形式是怎么样的，在充分考虑分数的同时，还要合理分析拟选的学校和专业，如果院校在招生章程中明确采取分数级差方式进行录取，考生在选择专业时，要注意各专业之间的梯度，提高录取几率。	When reporting major preferences, students and parents must be sure to carefully read the university’s admissions policies to see if there are major point deductions, and while considering the point values, must also carefully consider their universities and majors of choice; if the university lists clear major point deductions in the Admission Guidelines, they should pay close attention to the point tiers of different majors so they can maximize their chances of admission.	When filling in the report, the candidates and parents must read the admission policy of the reported school carefully, to see if there is a professional grade difference, what is the form of the grade difference, while giving due consideration to the scores, but also to rationally analyze the proposed school and major, if the university clearly takes the score difference in the admissions charter for admission, candidates should pay attention to the gradient between the majors and improve the odds of admission	When filling in the volunteer application, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the reported school to see if there is any professional grade difference, the form of grade difference is how, in full consideration of the score at the same time, but also a reasonable analysis of the proposed schools and majors, if the institutions in the admission charter clearly take the grade difference way for admission, candidates in the choice of major, pay attention to the gradient between each major

过渡到为人父母的时期是新任父母们面临的最紧张的调适期之一，无论是与个体自我的关系还是与他者的关系。针对这种过渡时期的代际关系之间的双向关联的研究非常有限，而且相互关系的复杂性也会根据生活居住情境的不同而变化。本研究旨在探索（1）过渡为家长期间，夫妻婚姻关系和与对方父母的冲突两者之间的双向关联性，以及（2）和父亲同住对上述关系的调适影响作用。本文的研究对象是359名已婚母亲，采用了三波前瞻性长期性研究设计。使用二元调整量表和斯特赖克调整清单量表来评估婚姻关系以及与对方父母的冲突关系。研究相互关系时使用的是交叉时滞平面分析，确定这些关系是否随着生活情境的不同而呈现出不同的模式时使用的是多群组分析。两个交叉－时滞模型表明，在怀孕中期至后期，婚内问题和与对方父母的冲突之间存在着双向关系。同时，多群组分析表明，在妊娠期间与父母同住的受试组中，与对方父母的冲突会引发婚内问题；而不与父母同住的受试组中，在怀孕后期到产后期，与对方父亲之间的关系冲突可能强化婚姻问题。这些研究发现揭示了代际冲突的交叉时滞关联性。医疗保健专业人员有必要确保在过渡为父母的过程中，代际关系是积极有利的。本研究丰富了我们对于和父亲同住这个因素对婚姻关系的作用的认知，并能指导基于特定文化的多维度干预方式的未来发展。	The transition to parenthood is one of the most stressful intra- and interpersonal adjustment periods for new parents.Bidirectional associations among intergenerational relationships during the transition to parenthood have received limited attention, and the complexity of reciprocal relationships varies in accordance with living arrangements.The objectives of this study were to explore (1) the bidirectional associations between marital relationships and conflicts with in-laws during the transition to parenthood and (2) the moderation of patrilineal coresidence on the aforementioned relationships.A three-wave prospective longitudinal design was adopted for 359 married mothers.The Dyadic Adjustment Scale and Stryker Adjustment Checklist were used to assess marital relationships and conflicts with parents-in-law.Cross-lagged panel analysis was applied to examine reciprocal relationships, and multigroup analyses were employed to determine whether these relationships exhibited different patterns in accordance with the individuals' living arrangements.The two cross-lagged models revealed the presence of a bidirectional relationship between marital distress and conflicts with parents-in-law during the mid- to late pregnancy stages.Meanwhile, the multigroup analyses suggested that conflicts with parents-in-law triggered marital distress during pregnancy in the coresidence group, whereas conflicts with fathers-in-law could intensify marital distress during late pregnancy to the postpartum period in the noncoresidence group.These findings shed light on cross-lagged associations with intergenerational conflicts.Healthcare professionals need to ensure that intergenerational relationships are positive during the transition to parenthood.This study enriches our understanding of the effect of patrilineal coresidence and can guide the future development of interventions based on culturally specific multidimensional approaches.

线性回归模型被广泛应用于精神卫生和卫生服 务相关研究。然而，经典线性回归分析是假设该数据 为正态分布的，但是很多研究所获得的数据并不符合 这种假设。解决该问题的方法之一是采用不要求数据 为正态分布的半参数模型。但是，半参数模型对离散 数据相当敏感，因此在处理包含离散值的数据时产生 的估计值是不可靠的。在这种情况下，一些研究者在 删减这些极端值后再进行分析，但是，删减数据的事 先法则（ad-hoc rules）是基于主观标准的，所以不同 的调整方法就会产生不同的结果。等级回归为处理包 括离散值的非正态分布数据提供了更为客观的方法。本文采用虚拟和实际数据来阐述这个非常有用的处理 离散值的回归方法，并与采用经典回归模型和半参数 回归模型所得出的结果进行比较。	Linear regression models are widely used in mental health and related health services research.However, the classic linear regression analysis assumes that the data are normally distributed, an assumption that is not met by the data obtained in many studies.One method of dealing with this problem is to use semi-parametric models, which do not require that the data be normally distributed.But semi-parametric models are quite sensitive to outlying observations, so the generated estimates are unreliable when study data includes outliers.In this situation, some researchers trim the extreme values prior to conducting the analysis, but the ad-hoc rules used for data trimming are based on subjective criteria so different methods of adjustment can yield different results.Rank regression provides a more objective approach to dealing with non-normal data that includes outliers.This paper uses simulated and real data to illustrate this useful regression approach for dealing with outliers and compares it to the results generated using classical regression models and semi-parametric regression models.	Linear regression models are widely used in studies related to mental health and health services.However, classical linear regression analysis assumes the normal distribution of the data, but many studies do not match this assumption.One way to solve this problem is to adopt a half-parameter model that does not require the data to be normal distributions.However, the semi-parameter model is quite sensitive to discrete data and therefore the estimates generated when processing data containing discrete values are not reliable.In this case, some researchers can then delete these extreme values, but the ad-hoc rules are based on subjective criteria, so different adjustment methods produce different results.Graded regression provides a more objective way to process non-regular distributive data, including discrete values.This paper uses virtual and actual data to illustrate this very useful regression method for dealing with discrete values and to compare the results obtained using classical regression models and semi-parameter regression models.

低收入伴侣的关系教育（RE）干预的结果有好也有坏。对于经历了积极变化的伴侣而言，项目模型的哪些方面起到了积极促进变化的作用尚不清楚。很多低收入的伴侣参加政府资助的关系教育，同时对社会和社区的支持等方面的资源获取和利用却十分有限。项目模型通常提供了相关的资源来补充关系教育中的具体技巧训练。本文研究的是收入，社会支持，家庭功能三者之间的关系，也研究社会支持对家庭功能结果的调和作用。研究对象为参加关系教育的856对低收入伴侣，来自多种族。分析包括三个独立的二元模型，用于研究相关的处在在基线的元素之间的关联性，和也包括立刻跟踪关系教育干预的结果。研究结果显示参与者报告的社会支持和家庭功能之间的关系表现在：(a) 社会支持和和男性、女性的基线家庭功能都有相关性； (b) 男性基线社会支持受女性基线家庭功能影响; (c) 男性和女性的社会支持变化分数对他们自身的家庭功能变化分数有积极影响。但是社会支持并不是家庭功能变化的重要调节因素。关系教育如何实施和相关研究在研究启示部分有所讨论。	Results are mixed for relationship education (RE) interventions with low-income couples.For couples who experienced positive changes, it is not clear what aspects of program models contributed to change.Many low-income couples attend government-funded RE with limited access to social and community resources.Program models often provide related resources complimentary to RE skill-building.We examined the relationship between income, social support, and family functioning for low-income, ethnically diverse couples (N = 856) who attended RE, as well as the mediating effects of social support on family functioning outcomes.Analyses included three separate dyadic models that examined associations among constructs at baseline and immediately following the RE intervention.Results demonstrated relationships between participants' reported social support and family functioning such that (a) social support was associated with baseline family functioning for both men and women; (b) men's baseline social support was influenced by women's baseline family functioning; and (c) men's and women's social support change score had a positive influence on their own family functioning change score.However, social support was not a significant mediator of change in family functioning.Implications for RE practice and research are also discussed.	Relationship education (RE) interventions by low-income partners have had both good and bad outcomes.For partners who have experienced positive change, it is not clear which aspects of the project model have played a positive role in promoting change.Many low-income partners participate in government-funded relationship education, while access to and use of resources, including social and community support, is limited.Project models usually provide relevant resources to complement specific skills training in relationship education.This paper examines the relationship between income, social support, and family function, as well as the role of social support in reconciling family function outcomes.The study looked at 856 pairs of low-income partners who participated in relationship education and came from a multiracial backgroundThe analysis consists of three independent binary models that examine the correlation between the relevant elements at the baseline and also include the immediate tracking of the results of the relational education intervention.The results showed that the relationship between social support and family function reported by the participants was: (a) social support was correlated with both male and female baseline family function; (b) male baseline social support was influenced by female baseline family function; and (c) male and female social support change scores had a positive impact on their own family function change scores.But social support is not an important regulator of changes in family function.How relational education is implemented and related research is discussed in the study revelations section.

信号通路中风险基因的构成可能可以解释酒精依赖风险基因协同的神经生物学作用。识别酒精依赖的风险基因和风险基因通路。我们采用基因富集 (gene-set-rich) 分析方法对酒精依赖进行了基于通路的全基因组关联分析 (GWAS)。在包括1409名欧裔美国人(European-American，EA)酒精依赖者和1518 名EA健康对照者的探索性样本人群中检测了近一百万个基因标志物。此外，将681名非裔美国人 (African-American, AA) 病例和508名AA健康受试者作为重测样本。我们发现了几个与酒精依赖显著相关的可重复的全基因组风险基因和风险通路。在多重比较Bonferroni校正后，“细胞- 细胞外基质相互作用”通路(EA样本中 一些基因和生物信号传导过程可能与酒精依赖的风险相关，本研究的发现为此提供了新的证据。	The organization of risk genes within signaling pathways may provide clues about the converging neurobiological effects of risk genes for alcohol dependence.Identify risk genes and risk gene pathways for alcohol dependence.We conducted a pathway-based genome-wide association study (GWAS) of alcohol dependence using a gene-set-rich analytic approach.Approximately one million genetic markers were tested in the discovery sample which included 1409 European-American (EA) alcohol dependent individuals and 1518 EA healthy comparison subjects.An additional 681 African-American (AA) cases and 508 AA healthy subjects served as the replication sample.We identified several genome-wide replicable risk genes and risk pathways that were significantly associated with alcohol dependence.After applying the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, the 'cellextracellular matrix interactions' pathway (p<2.0E-4 in EAs) and the PXN gene (which encodes paxillin) (p=3.9E-7 in EAs) within this pathway were the most promising risk factors for alcohol dependence.There were also two nominally replicable pathways enriched in alcohol dependence-related genes in both EAs (0.015≤p≤0.035) and AAs (0.025≤p≤0.050): the 'Na+/Cl- dependent neurotransmitter transporters' pathway and the 'other glycan degradation' pathway.These findings provide new evidence highlighting several genes and biological signaling processes that may be related to the risk for alcohol dependence.	The formation of risk genes in signal pathways may explain the neurobiological role of alcohol-dependent risk gene coordination.Identify risk genes and risk genetic pathways for alcohol dependence.We conducted a pathway-based genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) of alcohol dependence using gene-set-rich analysis.Nearly one million genetic markers were tested in an exploratory sample group that included 1,409 European-American (EA) alcohol-dependent people and 1,518 EA health controllers.In addition, 681 African American (AA) cases and 508 AA healthy subjects were retested.We identified several repeatable genome-wide risk genes and risk pathways that were significantly associated with alcohol dependence.After multiple comparisons of Bonferroni correction, the "cell-cell extracellular matrix interaction" pathway (some of the gene and biosignaling processes in the EA sample may be related to the risk of alcohol dependence) provides new evidence for this finding.

Retrospective analysis of clinical characteristics and laboratory characteristics of 38 adult patients with LCH diagnosed with histopathology at our hospital between January 2010 and August 2019. In-depth analysis of clinical prognosis. The median age of 38 patients with LCH was 41 (21-65 years old), with a ratio of 2: 1 men to women.Of the 38 patients with LCH, 44.7 had multisystem involvement, 31.6 had involvement of dangerous organs (liver, lungs, hematopoietic system or spleen), the most common organ involved was bone (21 / 38, 55.3) and the most common clinical symptom was pain (19 / 38, 50.0).Laboratory tests showed that rates of anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, lymphocytopenia, monocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein, elevated blood sedimentation and elevated ferritin were 10.5, 2.6, 5.3, 15.8, 28.9, 28.6 (6 / 21), 55.3 (10 / 18) and 55.3 (9 / 17)The median follow-up time was 53 months and a total of five patients died.The 10-year total survival (OS) rate for single-system patients is 100, significantly better than for multi-system patients (70.1) (P 0.0078).The prognosis of patients with non-hazardous organ involvement was significantly better than that of patients with dangerous organ involvement, with 10-year OS rates of 100 percent and 60.6 percent (P 0.0007), respectivelyFurther analysis found that in addition to multisystem involvement and risk organ involvement as adverse prognostic factors, peripheral blood mononucleosis and ferritin elevation at initial diagnosis were significantly associated with poor prognosis.
从一个人的社会网络对某关系的认可程度已可以预测这种关系的结局。还有一些研究表明，依恋行为可以缓冲各种因素（例如抑郁）对人际关系的负面影响。本研究样本包括858对已婚夫妇，我们在SEM框架内使用行为者-伴侣相互依存模型来探究来自父母和朋友方面的不同意对自己和伴侣的婚姻关系质量的影响。我们还研究每个配偶的依恋行为是否能够减缓这些影响。结果表明，不管男性和女性，某一方本人的依恋行为减轻了父母和朋友的不同意对他们自我报告的关系质量的影响。伴侣的依恋行为减轻了自己朋友对男女自我报告的关系质量的不同意的影响；此外，伴侣的父母和朋友的不同意造成的主要影响在该测试中作用不大。该发现支持的结论是伴侣双方的依恋行为有缓冲作用，即对来自社会网络成员的不同意对伴侣关系结果的负面影响方面能发挥作用。临床意义进行了讨论。	The degree of approval for a relationship from one's social network has been shown to predict relationship outcomes.Additional research has shown that attachment can buffer the negative effects of various factors (e.g., depression) on relationships.Using an actor-partner interdependence model in an SEM framework, we research the effects of disapproval from parents and friends for one's relationship on marital relationship quality for self and partner in a sample of 858 married couples.We also examine whether each spouse's attachment behaviors can moderate these effects.Results indicated that one's own attachment behaviors moderate the effects of their own parents' and friends' disapproval on their self-reported relationship quality for both men and women.Partner's attachment behaviors moderate own friend's disapproval on self-reported relationship quality for men and women; additionally, the main effect of partner's friends' and parents' disapproval became nonsignificant with that test.The findings provide evidence that attachment behaviors of both partners play a role in buffering the negative effects of the social network disapproval on relationship outcomes.Clinical implications are discussed.

临床实践指南, 如关注于创伤性应激治疗的指南, 可以在提升包容性和公平性方面发挥重要作用。在对14项明确提及儿童的国际创伤治疗指导文件综述的基础上, 我们对这些指南可以变得更具包容性和公平性的两个领域进行了反思; a) 儿童文化背景的体现, b) 儿童表达其声音的机会。尽管有几条准则提到应根据儿童的文化需求量身定制治疗方法, 但关于这一点如何实现的指导却很少。而且, 在产生和评估国际证据基础的各个阶段, 似乎仍然有强烈的西方白人眼光。现有指南还意味着在指南开发过程中未咨询18岁以下的青年。为了促进包容性和公平性, 我们建议了未来国家指南制定工作的五个要素。对于目前代表性不足的群体, 与其一同以及针对目前代表性不足的群体来促进研究和指南开发, 应该是我们领域的高度优先事项。我们国家, 地区和全球专业协会在 (继续) 促进这一领域的对话和行动方面处于优势地位。	Clinical practice guidelines, such as those focusing on traumatic stress treatment, can play an important role in promoting inclusion and equity.Based on a review of 14 international trauma treatment guidance documents that explicitly mentioned children, we reflect on two areas in which these guidelines can become more inclusive and equitable; a) representation of children's cultural background and b) children's opportunity to have their voice heard.While a few guidelines mentioned that treatment should be tailored to children's cultural needs, there was little guidance on how this could be done.Moreover, there still appears to be a strong white Western lens across all stages of producing and evaluating the international evidence base.The available documentation also suggested that no young people under the age of 18 had been consulted in the guideline development processes.To contribute to inclusion and equity, we suggest five elements for future national guideline development endeavours.Promoting research and guideline development with, by, and for currently under-represented communities should be a high priority for our field.Our national, regional and global professional associations are in an excellent position to (continue to) stimulate conversation and action in this domain.

系统方法研究家庭和健康应该把握住复杂的网络 ，在这个网络里家庭成员都交织在一起，这个网络包括了多重家庭关系和更大的保健系统。但是，聚焦于成人家庭成员的家庭和健康相关研究很多都只关注亲密关系，也就是婚姻关系。成人维护的有强大影响力的家庭关系中还有很多其他的关系都被忽视了，而且随着年龄变大，越会对亲密关系更关注。本文对家庭和成人健康相关文献进行系统性研究，72篇筛选出的文章依次按照主题进行解码，找到这个领域内的主要核心主题。结果表明有六大主题，其包括：家庭关系质量，家庭结构，健康和保健方面的行为因素，心理身体调节因素，看护情况，和老年人健康。研究结果支持在成人健康方面的研究中较少得到代表的家庭成员，而不仅仅是亲密伴侣。	A systemic approach to researching families and health should capture the complex network within which family members are embedded, including multiple family relationships and larger systems of health care.However, much of the families and health research focused on adult family members has focused solely on intimate partnerships, usually the marital relationship.This neglects the remainder of the powerfully influencing family relationships adults retain, and may increasingly focus on as they age.We conducted a systematic review of the families and adult health literature, retaining 72 articles which were subsequently thematically coded to highlight main foci of this area of research.Results highlight six themes, which include family relationship quality, family composition, behavioral factors in health and health care, psychophysiological mediators, caregiving, and aging health.Findings support an underrepresentation of family members, other than the intimate partner, in research on adult health.

家庭层面的冲突和家庭的凝聚力是公认的衡量青少年心理健康的指标。但是，传统研究方法侧重于家庭和家庭之间在凝聚力和冲突方面的差异，通常会忽略某个具体家庭内部的日常变异性，而后者可能会提供重要的新信息。本研究的参与者来自家中有两个照料者的家庭的照顾者共151名（女性占95.3％），以及他们的青春期孩子（女性占61.5％），我们使用的数据来自他们持续21天的每日记录中的数据，用以测试家庭功能的每日变化是否与青少年的幸福感的每日变化相关，以及青少年的幸福感是否取决于家庭功能的平均水平。我们采用多层次模型来研究家庭凝聚力和家庭冲突，他们与青少年生气，沮丧和焦虑情绪以及快乐，生活满意度以及生活中的意义和目的之间的相互关联。研究得出在凝聚力和冲突方面，每天都表现出有意义的变化。青少年报告的凝聚力和冲突与六个青春期结果之间有特殊的家庭内部的关联。使用父母方面报告的家庭功能数据的模型所产生的关联要少于使用青少年方面报告的数据的模型。本研究还有几个发现。跨层次的交互作用表明，家庭内的凝聚力差异仅与生活在家庭内聚力平均水平以下的家庭的青少年抑郁有关。总而言之，这项研究提供了令人信服的证据，表明家庭生活每天都会表现出有意义的差异性，而且每日的差异都会对青少年的幸福感具有重要的影响。	Family-level conflict and cohesion are well-established predictors of adolescent mental health.However, traditional approaches focusing on between-family differences in cohesion and conflict may overlook daily intrafamily variability that might provide important new information.We used data from a 21-day daily diary protocol in a sample of 151 caregivers (95.3% female) and their adolescent child (61.5% female) in two-caregiver families to test whether daily changes in family functioning are associated with daily changes in adolescent well-being and whether adolescent well-being depends on average levels of family functioning.We examined family cohesion and conflict in relation to adolescent angry, depressed, and anxious mood, as well as happiness, life satisfaction, and meaning and purpose in life in multilevel models.Both cohesion and conflict exhibited meaningful daily variation.Adolescent-reported cohesion and conflict had unique within-family associations with all six adolescent outcomes.Models using parent reports of family functioning yielded fewer associations than models with adolescent reports; however, several findings remained.Cross-level interactions indicated that within-family variations in cohesion were only associated with adolescent depression in families with lower average levels of cohesion across days.In sum, this study provides compelling evidence that families exhibit meaningful variability from day to day and that daily variation has important implications for adolescent well-being.	Conflict at the family level and family cohesion are recognized indicators of adolescent mental health.However, traditional research methods that focus on differences in cohesion and conflict between families and families often ignore the daily variability within a particular household, which may provide important new information.The study involved 151 caregivers (95.3 women) from families with two caregivers at home and 61.5 adolescent children. We used data from their daily records for 21 days to test whether the daily changes in family function are related to the daily changes in the happiness of adolescents and whether the happiness of adolescents depends on the average family function.We used multilayered models to study family cohesion and family conflict, their correlation with adolescent anger, frustration and anxiety and happiness, life satisfaction, and meaning and purpose in life.Studies have shown meaningful changes in cohesion and conflict every day.There is a particular intra-family correlation between adolescent reported cohesion and conflict and six adolescent outcomes.Models using data on family function reported by parents produce fewer correlations than models using data reported by adolescents.There are several other findings from this study.Interactions across levels show that differences in cohesion within households are related only to adolescent depression in families living below the average level of family cohesion.Taken together, the study provides compelling evidence that family life shows meaningful differences every day, and that daily differences can have a significant impact on adolescent happiness.

本研究旨在验证以下假设,即父母对孩童应对能力的培养(SOC)与孩子的情绪调节能力之间的关系是长期的。样本来自256位父母,其孩子年龄在5至12岁之间(儿童平均年龄= 8.36,SD = 2.03,男性54.7%;父母平均年龄= 34.49,SD = 6.20,女性59%)。参与者被要求在起始阶段和12个月时填写在线问卷,以供收集有关人口统计学信息,育儿行为和儿童情绪调节能力方面的数据。纵向性的结构方程模型(SEM)分析的结果表明,在基线测量的父母SOC预测了孩子12个月后测量到的在情绪调节方面的适应和调适不良的结果。更具体地说,父母的积极培养孩子应对策略方面的建议预测了孩子情绪调节方面的适应性,而父母缺乏对孩童应对能力的培养则预测了孩子在情绪调节方面的不良调适能力。此外,在家长积极培养应对策略与儿童情绪调节适应性之间的纵向联系中,儿童性别起了调节作用:尽管这种联系很小,对女孩来说相对微小,而对于男孩则较大,并且具有统计学的显著意义。本项研究结果强调了家长的SOC的重要性,因为它有可能提高5至12岁儿童的情绪调节能力。	This study examined the hypothesis that parent socialization of coping (SOC) would have a longitudinal relation with child emotion regulation abilities.Participants included a sample of 256 parents of 5- to 12-year-old children (child M age = 8.36, SD = 2.03, 54.7% male; parent M age = 34.49, SD = 6.20, 59% female).Data on demographic information, parenting behaviors, and child emotion regulation abilities were collected via online questionnaires at baseline and 12 months.Results from longitudinal structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses suggested that parent SOC, measured at baseline, predicted child adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation, measured 12 months later.More specifically, parental engagement coping suggestions predicted child's adaptive emotion regulation, whereas parental disengagement coping suggestions predicted child's maladaptive emotion regulation.Further, child gender emerged as a moderator in the longitudinal association between socialization of engagement coping and child adaptive emotion regulation: Whereas this association was small and marginally significant for girls, it was large and statistically significant for boys.Results highlight the importance of parent SOC as potentially contributing to emotion regulation abilities of 5- to 12-year-olds.	This study aims to test the hypothesis that the relationship between parental development of a child's coping capacity (SOC) and the child's ability to regulate emotions is long-term.The sample came from 256 parents with children between the ages of 5 and 12 (average age of children 8.36, SD 2.03, male 54.7; average age of parents 34.49, SD 6.20, femaleParticipants were asked to fill out online questionnaires at the beginning stages and at 12 months to collect data on demographic information, parenting behavior and children's ability to regulate emotions.The results of the Longitudinal Structural Equations Model (SEM) analysis showed that the SOC of the parents who took the baseline measurements predicted the outcomes of poor adjustment and adjustment in mood regulation measured in the children after 12 months.More specifically, parents' advice on coping strategies for positive parenting predict the adaptability of a child's emotional regulation, while parents' lack of ability to cope predicts the child's maladaptive ability in emotional regulation.In addition, in the longitudinal link between parents' active nurturing of coping strategies and children's adaptability to emotional regulation, child sex plays a regulating role: although the link is small, it is relatively small for girls and larger for boys and statistically significant.The findings of this study highlight the importance of SOC for parents, as it has the potential to improve emotional conditioning in children between the ages of 5 and 12.

初级卫生保健为实现全民健康覆盖 (UHC) 提供了一种经济有效的途径。然而在许多中低收入国家，初级卫生保健体系非常薄弱，常常无法提供全面的以人为本的综合保健。我们利用半扎根的研究方法分析了 20 个中低收入国家的初级卫生保健体系。通过分析主题内容确定了加强初级保健体系的备选方案。我们发现：(I) 尽管非传染性疾病负担日益沉重，但许多中低收入国家仍缺乏预防服务资金；(ii) 社区卫生工作者通常资源配备不足，无法获得良好的支持，并且缺乏相应培训；(iii) 在所研究的一半国家中，医疗自费超出卫生支出总额的 40％，不利于实现公平；(iv) 公共和私人体系分散、资金不足、腐败以及非正式员工参与不足，阻碍了健康保险计划的实施。14 个国家中，私营部门基本上不受监管。此外，服务基本私有化的国家，社区很少参与初级卫生保健。一些国家权力下放，促使其初级保健分散。当财政激励措施与法规和质量提升相结合，，并且社区参与度增强时，绩效便会有所改善。应该为初级卫生保健的决策制定提供充足的资源，并将政府在初级卫生保健方面的支出至少增加国内生产总值的 1％。还需要制定提升公平的融资方案，加强初级卫生保健管理的问责。初级卫生保健体系的支持对于在截止 2030 年的十年中实现 UHC 至关重要。	Primary health care offers a cost-effective route to achieving universal health coverage (UHC).However, primary health-care systems are weak in many low- and middle-income countries and often fail to provide comprehensive, people-centred, integrated care.We analysed the primary health-care systems in 20 low- and middle-income countries using a semi-grounded approach.Options for strengthening primary health-care systems were identified by thematic content analysis.We found that: (i) despite the growing burden of noncommunicable disease, many low- and middle-income countries lacked funds for preventive services; (ii) community health workers were often under-resourced, poorly supported and lacked training; (iii) out-of-pocket expenditure exceeded 40% of total health expenditure in half the countries studied, which affected equity; and (iv) health insurance schemes were hampered by the fragmentation of public and private systems, underfunding, corruption and poor engagement of informal workers.In 14 countries, the private sector was largely unregulated.Moreover, community engagement in primary health care was weak in countries where services were largely privatized.In some countries, decentralization led to the fragmentation of primary health care.Performance improved when financial incentives were linked to regulation and quality improvement, and community involvement was strong.Policy-making should be supported by adequate resources for primary health-care implementation and government spending on primary health care should be increased by at least 1% of gross domestic product.Devising equity-enhancing financing schemes and improving the accountability of primary health-care management is also needed.Support from primary health-care systems is critical for progress towards UHC in the decade to 2030.	Primary health care provides a cost-effective way to achieve universal health coverage (UHC).However, in many low- and middle-income countries, primary health-care systems are so weak that they often fail to provide comprehensive, people-centred and integrated health care.Using a semi-rooted research methodology, we analysed the primary health-care systems of 20 low- and middle-income countries.The analysis of thematic content identified options for strengthening the primary health-care system.We found that: (i) despite the growing burden of non-communicable diseases, many low- and middle-income countries still lack funding for prevention services; (ii) community health workers are often under-resourced, poorly supported and poorly trained; (iii) out-of-pocket health spending exceeds 40 per cent of total health spending in half of the countries studied, which is not conducive to equity; and (iv) the implementation of health insurance schemes is hampered by fragmented public and private systems, underfunding, corruption and inadequate participation of informal workers.In 14 countries, the private sector is largely unregulated.Furthermore, in countries where services are largely privatized, there is little community participation in primary health care.Some countries have decentralized their primary health care.Performance improves when fiscal incentives are combined with regulatory and quality improvements and community participation is increased.Adequate resources should be made available for decision-making in primary health care and government spending on primary health care should be increased by at least 1 per cent of GDP.There is also a need for more equitable financing programmes and greater accountability in primary health-care management.Support from the primary health-care system is critical to achieving UHC by 2030.

李-佛美尼综合症是一种遗传性的疾病，大概一生中有90%的患癌几率，它要求家庭成员终身接受综合性癌症筛查。本文研究医疗保健对管理李-佛美尼综合症风险和治疗过程中所起的作用，这些风险和治疗均由家长，青少年和成年孩子们来承担着。参与研究的家庭有23个，采用半结构化的访谈。家庭的组成有2-5个家庭成员，每个家庭的较年轻一代人年龄跨度7-40岁。使用草根理论方法，我们针对访谈文稿进行了开放式和集中式解码。家庭成员描述了健康领袖的作用在家庭内如何实现的，还有孩子的成熟，某家庭成员的去世等因素，这些因素都决定了谁承担了什么角色，这些角色在一段时间范围内如何发生变化。他们通常会表达集体性的共同责任，帮助亲戚理解LFS症和实施合适的癌症风险管理。家庭成员通过陪同一起去就医来给与支持以及信息搜集的方式来实现他们的健康作用。健康领袖的作用是代际间的，提供了必要的支持给家庭，特别是在复杂的医疗保健方面的决定。我们的研究结果提供了健康医疗供给方的看法，主要是关于LFS病人和他们的亲戚如何作出特殊的医疗决策和发挥照料者的角色，这些都深受LFS遗传性特性的影响，和这些角色如何随着时间而发生变化。那些可以适应家庭角色动态变化的供给方可以较好地实现亲戚的社会心理和医疗的需要，主要是通过尽力理解承受LFS影响的家庭系统的功能，促进家庭成员们彼此的支持。	Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is a hereditary disorder that confers an approximately 90% lifetime risk of cancer and requires comprehensive lifetime cancer screening.We explored healthcare roles for managing LFS-related cancer risks and treatments that were assumed by parents, adolescents, and adult children.Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 families.Family groupings were comprised of 2-5 members, with the younger generation in each family ranging in age from 7 to 40 years.Using grounded theory methods, we conducted open and focused coding of interview transcript content.Family members described how the role of health leader was implemented in their family, as well as factors such as maturation of a child or death of a member that determined who assumed particular roles and how these roles shifted over time.They often expressed collective responsibility for helping relatives understand LFS and implement appropriate cancer risk management.Members demonstrated their health role by attending others' medical appointments for support or information gathering.The health leader role was intergenerational and provided the family necessary support in navigating complicated healthcare decisions.Our findings provide insight into healthcare providers regarding how LFS patients and their relatives develop unique medical decision-making and caring roles influenced by the hereditary nature of LFS, and how these roles change over time.Providers who are attuned to family role dynamics may be better able to meet relatives' psychosocial and medical needs by understanding how living with LFS influences the family system's functioning and facilitating members' support for each other.	Lee-Formenny syndrome is a hereditary disease with a roughly 90 chance of developing cancer in a lifetime.This paper examines the role of health care in managing the risks and treatments of Lee-Formeny syndrome, which are borne by parents, adolescents, and adults.Twenty-three families involved in the study used semi-structured interviews.The family is made up of two to five family members, and the younger members of each family are between 7 and 40 years of age.Using a grassroots theoretical approach, we decoded the interview transcripts in an open and centralized manner.Family members describe how the role of a healthy leader is achieved within the family, along with the maturation of the child, the death of a family member, and other factors that determine who takes on what roles and how those roles change over time.They typically express a collective responsibility to help relatives understand LFS and implement appropriate cancer risk management.Family members are accompanied to the hospital for support and information-gathering to achieve their health role.The role of health leaders is intergenerational and provides the necessary support to families, especially in complex healthcare decisions.Our findings provide insights from health care providers, primarily about how LFS patients and their relatives make specific medical decisions and play the role of caregiver, which are strongly influenced by the genetic characteristics of LFS, and how those roles change over time.Providers who can adapt to the changing dynamics of family roles can better meet the psychosocial and medical needs of relatives, mainly by trying to understand the functions of the family system that is affected by LFS, and by promoting mutual support among family members.

和高收入的伴侣相比,低收入伴侣之间的关系解体的比率要高得多,这种伴侣关系瓦解包括离婚和与同居的伴侣分手。认识到关系干预措施对关系发展的结果能造成差异,相关措施越来越多地针对此类人群使用。然而,这些干预对低收入伴侣的关系的影响却非常有限。面向低收入伴侣的关系干预措施要想有效且能对其需求有针对性回应,就需要描述类的数据,这些数据能反映这些伴侣自己如何看待他们关系出现的问题,以及和高收入的伴侣使用的代表性的干预措施比起来,他们如何评估他们自己的需要。本研究的样本来自网上招募的5,000个个体,他们在网上寻求关系干预,他们也比较低收入伴侣和较高收入伴侣这两类人群的关系状况和生活状况。结果表明低收入伴侣寻求关系干预时,关系经历着更高水平的痛苦(较低的关系满意度、主要关系问题更严重、关系稳定性也较差),整个生活境况也出现更高水平的紧张程度 (更多孩子在家生活、更不可能有全职的工作、健康状态堪忧)。结果表明在未来开发设计的干预措施应该着眼于低收入伴侣的需求,那些治疗低收入伴侣的医师也都要有准备去处理更高水平的关系紧张程度,导致他们生活环境紧张的多重因素,而这些是平日治疗更富足的伴侣时不常见的。	Compared to higher-income couples, low-income couples experience higher rates of relationship disruption, including divorce and breakup of cohabiting relationships.In recognition of this disparity in relationship outcomes, relationship interventions have increasingly been targeted at this population.However, these interventions have had limited impacts on the relationships of low-income couples.Developing interventions that are effective and responsive to the needs of low-income couples requires descriptive data on the challenges those couples perceive in their own relationships and an assessment of how their needs compare to the more affluent couples typically served by relationship interventions.The current study sampled over 5,000 individuals at the time they were seeking an online relationship intervention and compared the relationship functioning and life circumstances reported by low-income individuals to that of higher-income individuals.Results indicate that low-income individuals seeking a relationship intervention had higher levels of relationship distress (lower relationship satisfaction, more intense primary relationship problems, and less relationship stability), and had greater levels of contextual stress (more children living at home, less likely to be employed full-time, and lower levels of perceived health).Results suggest that future interventions designed to target low-income couples, as well as practitioners working with low-income couples, should be prepared to handle higher levels of relationship distress and contextual stressors than they may typically see in more affluent couples.	Compared to high-income partners, low-income partners have a much higher rate of dissolution of relationships, which includes divorce and separation from partners who live together.Recognizing that relationship interventions can make a difference in the outcomes of relationship development, they are increasingly targeted at such populations.However, the impact of these interventions on the relationships of low-income partners has been very limited.To be effective and responsive to the needs of low-income partners, relationship interventions require descriptive data that reflect how the partners themselves perceive problems in their relationships and how they assess their own needs compared with representative interventions used by high-income partners.The study was based on a sample of 5,000 individuals recruited online to seek relationship interventions, and they also compared the relationship status and living conditions of both low-income and higher-income partners.The results showed that when low-income partners sought relationship interventions, the relationship experienced a higher level of distress (lower relationship satisfaction, greater major relationship problems, and poorer relationship stability), and a higher level of tension in the overall life situation (more children living at home, less likely to work full-time, and poor health).The results suggest that interventions designed in the future should focus on the needs of low-income partners, and that physicians who treat low-income partners should also be prepared to deal with higher levels of relationship tension, the multiple factors that lead to stress in their living environment, which are not common when treating richer partners on weekdays.

研究认为男子童年时期的不良经历（ACEs）和精神创伤症状与其IPV犯罪行为（亲密伴侣暴力）和被虐待经历是有关联的，但是针对暴力实施干预措施时起到阻碍作用的几个重要方面尚未得到深入研究。具体而言，创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）主导了该领域所研究的创伤症状的范围，限制了研究者对创伤的其他表现形式的理解，尤其是男子的创伤。此外，大多数研究只侧重于男性在身体方面的 IPV 犯罪行为，很少聚焦于诸如其他类型的 IPV行为、暴力严重程度或男性受迫害等研究方向。另外，很少有研究关注基于ACE框架的可能性保护因素，例如临床人群的觉知行为。最后，大多数研究的对象还尚未关注到有色人种，尽管一些种族/少数民族群体对IPV的接触率比较高。基于以上原因，本研究调查了IPV的发生频率和严重程度（心理、身体、伤害）与ACES、PTSD、创伤症状学（与PTSD区别开来），还有觉知的自我效能之间的相互关联。样本来自67个有色人种的男子，他们大多数属于低收入，正在参与虐妻行为干预计划。超过一半的样本（51.5%）报告曾经经历过四次或四次以上 ACEs ，有31.1%的被研究对象 满足疑似 PTSD 病人诊断标准。较高的 ACE 分数预测了几乎所有类型的自报 的较高IPV 犯罪率和较高的受害比例。PTSD 症状和复杂性创伤症状的严重程度综合在一起解释了 13% 到 40% 的 IPV 结果，而且每种结果都与某些类型的自报 的IPV 受害和暴力实施频率和严重程度有独特的关联性。觉知的自我效能与犯罪行为和受害经历发生减少，自我报告的心理方面的IPV频率和严重程度呈减少趋势有关。本研究综述了针对非主流的边缘化男性群体所采取的相关临床措施，包括筛查、培训和可能采用的治疗性干预方法。	Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and trauma symptoms have been linked with intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration and victimization among men, yet the field lacks depth in several key areas hampering progress toward violence intervention.Specifically, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) dominates the field's scope of trauma symptoms under study, limiting understanding of other manifestations of trauma especially among men.Furthermore, most research focuses exclusively on men's physical IPV perpetration and rarely focuses on other types of IPV, severity of violence, or men's victimization.Also, few studies examine potential protective factors grounded in the ACE framework, such as mindfulness, among clinical populations.Finally, most research has not focused on men of color, despite some racial/ethnic minority groups disproportionate rates of IPV exposure.Therefore, the relationships between IPV frequency and severity (psychological, physical, injury) and ACEs, PTSD, trauma symptomology (separate from PTSD), and mindfulness self-efficacy were examined in a sample of 67 predominantly low-income men of color in a batterer intervention program.More than half of the sample (51.5%) reported exposure to four or more ACEs, and 31.1% met the clinical cutoff for a probable PTSD diagnosis.Higher ACE scores predicted increased rates for nearly all types of self-reported IPV perpetration and victimization.PTSD symptoms and complex trauma symptom severity together explained between 13% and 40% of IPV outcomes, and each was uniquely associated with certain types of self-reported IPV victimization and perpetration frequency and severity.Mindfulness self-efficacy was associated with decreased self-report psychological IPV perpetration and victimization frequency and severity.Clinical implications relevant to marginalized men are reviewed, including screening, training, and potential therapeutic interventions.	Studies have linked men's adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and trauma symptoms to their IPV offending (intimate-partner violence) and abusive experiences, but several important aspects that act as a disincentive when it comes to violence interventions have not been studied.In particular, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) dominates the range of trauma symptoms studied in this area, limiting researchers "understanding of other manifestations of trauma, particularly in men.In addition, most studies focus only on physical IPV crimes committed by men, with little focus on research directions such as other types of IPV behavior, severity of violence or male persecution.In addition, few studies have focused on potential protective factors based on the ACE framework, such as cognitive behavior in clinical populations.Finally, most of the study's subjects have yet to focus on people of color, although some racial / ethnic minority groups have higher rates of exposure to IPV.For these reasons, the study investigated the correlation between the frequency and severity of IPV occurrence (psychological, physical, injury) and ACES, PTSD, trauma symptomology (distinct from PTSD), and conscious self-efficacy.The sample comes from 67 men of color, most of whom are low-income and are participating in wife-abuse intervention programs.More than half of the sample (51.5) reported having experienced ACEs four or more times, and 31.1 of those studied met the criteria for diagnosis of suspected PTSD in patients.Higher ACE scores predict higher IPV crime and higher victimization rates for almost all types of self-reported crimes.The combination of PTSD symptoms and the severity of complex trauma symptoms explains between 13 and 40 percent of IPV outcomes, and each outcome is uniquely correlated with the frequency and severity of certain types of self-reported IPV victimization and violence.Conscious self-efficacy is associated with a decrease in the incidence of crime and victimization experiences, and a decrease in the frequency and severity of self-reported psychological aspects of IPV.The study provides an overview of relevant clinical interventions, including screening, training and possible therapeutic interventions, for non-dominant and marginalized groups of men.	Studies have linked men's adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and trauma symptoms to their IPV criminal behaviour (intimate partner violence) and abuse experiences, but several important aspects that act as barriers to violence interventions have not been thoroughly studied.Specifically, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) dominates the range of trauma symptoms studied in the field, limiting researchers' understanding of other manifestations of trauma, particularly in men.In addition, most studies focus only on men's physical aspects of IPV criminal behavior, with little focus on areas of research such as other types of IPV behavior, severity of violence or male persecution.Also, few studies have focused on possible protective factors based on the ACE framework, such as cognitive behavior in clinical populations.Finally, most study participants have yet to focus on people of color, although some racial / ethnic minority groups have relatively high rates of exposure to IPV.For these reasons, this study investigates the correlation between frequency and severity of IPV (psychological, physical, injury) and ACES, PTSD, trauma symptomology (as distinct from PTSD), and conscious self-efficacy.The sample was drawn from 67 men of color, most of whom were low income and were participating in a wife abuse intervention program.More than half of the samples (51.5 percent) reported having experienced four or more ACEs, and 31.1 percent of those studied met diagnostic criteria for patients with suspected PTSD.Higher ACE scores predict higher self-reported IPV crime rates and higher victimization rates for almost all types.The severity of PTSD symptoms and complex trauma symptoms combined explain 13 to 40 percent of IPV outcomes, and each result is uniquely associated with the frequency and severity of certain types of self-reported IPV victimization and violence.Awareness of self-efficacy is associated with a decrease in criminal behaviour and victimization experiences and a decrease in the frequency and severity of self-reported psychological aspects of IPV.This study provides an overview of relevant clinical interventions targeting non-mainstream marginalized groups of men, including screening, training and possible therapeutic interventions.
家庭成员间的紧密联系对青少年的幸福有着重要的影响，有助于他们的身体、心理和社会健康。但是，人们对于这些作用的潜在机制知之甚少。本研究是一项长期性研究，考察了青少年认识的家庭成员间的紧密联系的过程，该过程预测了随着时间的推移，青少年有较多的积极健康行为和较少的消极健康行为。我们尤其是着力弄清楚适应性的和调适性不良的应对策略是否调和了家庭紧密性与青少年方面自我报告的健康状况之间的联系。此研究的数据来自1774名10至17岁的新西兰青少年，他们一年一次完成3次自我报告问卷调查。通过使用纵向调解路径模型，我们测试了T2的适应不良和适应性应对策略是否在T1的家庭紧密性与在T3的总体健康、活力、睡眠充足、身体满意度、物质使用和自我伤害之间起调和作用。研究结果表明，紧密的家庭关系预示着适应性应对能力的水平偏高，而适应性应对能力则预示着健康指标会提高，但疾病指标却没有下降。此外，家庭成员间的紧密联系预示了面对压力挫折时的调适不良情况的降低，这反过来又预示了积极的健康结果水平更高和不良的健康结果偏少。本研究的结果表明，家庭成员的紧密联系对青少年健康有积极影响，它是通过增加使用适应性应对策略，减少使用应对压力挫折时的不良调适策略，或两者兼而有之。这些结果对于以青少年和父母为工作对象的临床治疗师以及开发促进健康计划的相关人员具有重要意义。	Family connectedness has important implications for adolescents' well-being, contributing to their physical, psychological, and social health.However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying these effects.The present longitudinal study examined the process by which family connectedness, as perceived by adolescents, predicted greater positive and fewer negative health behaviors in adolescents over time.In particular, we sought to determine whether adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies mediated the link between family connectedness and adolescents' self-reported health status.Data were obtained from 1,774 New Zealand adolescents aged 10-17 years, who completed a self-report survey three times at one-year intervals.With longitudinal mediation path models, we tested whether maladaptive and adaptive coping strategies at T2 functioned as mediators between family connectedness at T1 and overall health, vitality, sleep sufficiency, body satisfaction, substance use, and self-harm at T3.Findings revealed that family connectedness predicted greater levels of adaptive coping, which, in turn, predicted better health indicators but not decreases in ill-health indicators.Furthermore, family connectedness predicted lower maladaptive coping, which, in turn, predicted higher levels of positive health outcomes and fewer negative health outcomes.Results showed that the positive effect of family connectedness on adolescents' health occurred through increased use of adaptive coping strategies, decreased use of maladaptive coping strategies, or both.These results have important implications for practitioners working with adolescents and parents, as well as for health promotion program developers.	Strong bonds between family members have an important impact on the well-being of adolescents and contribute to their physical, psychological and social health.But little is known about the potential mechanisms of these roles.The study, a long-term study, examined the process of close bonding between family members that teens knew was predicted to have more positive and less negative health behaviors over time.In particular, we focus on finding out whether adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies reconcile family tightness with self-reported health outcomes among adolescents.The data for the study came from 1,774 New Zealand teenagers aged 10 to 17 who completed a self-reported questionnaire three times a year.Using the longitudinal mediation pathway model, we tested whether T2's maladaptive and adaptive coping strategies played a reconciling role between T1 "s family tightness and T3" s overall health, vitality, adequate sleep, physical satisfaction, substance useThe findings show that close family ties signal high levels of adaptive coping abilities, which predict higher health indicators but no decline in disease indicators.In addition, the close bond between family members indicates a reduction in maladaptation in the face of stress setbacks, which in turn indicates higher levels of positive health outcomes and lower levels of poor health outcomes.The findings of this study show that close bonds among family members have a positive impact on adolescent health by increasing the use of adaptive coping strategies, reducing the use of maladaptive strategies when coping with stress setbacks, or both.These results are important for clinical therapists working with adolescents and parents, as well as those involved in developing health promotion programs.

撒哈拉以南非洲地区的总人口占全球的12%, 其中430万人失明, 1500多万人视力受损。但SSA每一百万人中只有2.5名眼科医生。所以在该地区对眼科医生的培训至关重要。我们设计了一套系统文献综述的方案, MEDLINE、Ovid和Embase OVID并对发表于2019年8月1日至2000年之后的文献进行了检索。我们还检索了Google Scholar和其他眼科机构的网站, 以获取更多信息。本文共纳入49篇参考文献, 并采用叙述的方式对结果进行分析。在11个英语国家, 11个法语国家和2个葡萄牙语的SSA国家中, 有56个针对眼科医生的培训机构。眼科培训课程时长的中位数为4年。大多数课程都进行了地区标准化。在一半以上的眼科培训计划中, 国内的、省内的和国际间的合作是眼科培训的关键特征。尽管可能并不总是循证的, 但该地区的专业细化仍被推动着。现有的SSA地区眼科医疗和外科培训已发表的科学数据很少, 特别是法语和葡萄牙语国家。然而, 通过广泛的审查策略, 我们有可能获得SSA眼科培训宝贵而详细的全貌。眼科医生的培训是一项复杂而又多方面的任务。现有的培训机构面临着合适的选择、能力和资金方面的挑战。许多学习成果需要课程、时间、师资、支持和适当的评估。现代培训方法提供了很多机会。合作是关键。	Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 12% of the global population, and 4.3 million are blind and over 15 million are visually impaired.There are only 2.5 ophthalmologists per million people in SSA.Training of ophthalmologists is critical.We designed a systematic literature review protocol, searched MEDLINE Ovid and Embase OVID on 1 August 2019 and limited these searches to the year 2000 onwards.We also searched Google Scholar and websites of ophthalmic institutions for additional information.We include a total of 49 references in this review and used a narrative approach to synthesise the results.There are 56 training institutions for ophthalmologists in eleven Anglophone, eleven Francophone, and two Lusophone SSA countries.The median duration of ophthalmology training programmes was 4 years.Most curricula have been regionally standardised.National, regional and international collaborations are a key feature to ophthalmology training in more than half of ophthalmology training programmes.There is a drive, although perhaps not always evidence-based, for sub-specialisation in the region.Available published scientific data on ophthalmic medical and surgical training in SSA is sparse, especially for Francophone and Lusophone countries.However, through a broad scoping review strategy it has been possible to obtain a valuable and detailed view of ophthalmology training in SSA.Training of ophthalmologists is a complex and multi-faceted task.There are challenges in appropriate selection, capacity, and funding of available training institutions.Numerous learning outcomes demand curriculum, time, faculty, support, and appropriate assessment.There are opportunities provided by modern training approaches.Partnership is key.

直接抗病毒药物（DAAs），是治疗慢性乙型肝炎的重要手段。DAAs能直接干扰病毒的感染复制过程，减少子代病毒产率，继而影响体内乙型肝炎病毒（HBV）的两种动态平衡，即肝细胞中病毒复制-循环中病毒衰减之间的平衡，共价闭合环状DNA（cccDNA）池补充-cccDNA衰减之间的平衡。现有核苷（酸）类似物足以影响第一种平衡，却难以撼动第二种平衡。因此，靶向HBV感染复制的不同环节，开发新型DAAs十分必要。现从cccDNA池补充-cccDNA衰减这一平衡的两个方面，探讨近期DAAs研发的主要进展。	Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) play a critical role for the therapy of chronical hepatitis B.DAAs can decrease the production of viral progeny of hepatitis B virus (HBV), breaking the viral dynamic equilibrium between: (1) virion production from hepatocytes and clearance from circulation; (2) replenishment and decay of covalently closed circular (ccc)DNA pool inside infected hepatocytes.Nucleos(t)ide analogues can potently shift the first balance to undetectable viremia in the blood, but have limited or no effect on the second one, thus making it imperative to develop new agents targeting additional step(s) of HBV life cycle.We herein briefly introduce the DAAs currently in development by classifying them as agents affecting the replenishment or the decay of cccDNA pool.	Direct antiviral drugs (DAAs) are an important means of treating chronic hepatitis B.DAAs can directly interfere with the viral replication process and reduce the yield of subgenerative viruses, which in turn affect the two dynamic equilibria of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the body, that is, the balance between virus replication in liver cells - virus decay in circulation, and covalent closed cyclic DNA (cccDNA) pool supplement - cccDNA decay.The existing nucleoside (acid) analogue is enough to influence the first equilibrium, but it is difficult to shake the secondTherefore, the development of new types of DAAs is necessary for the replication of vertical HBV infection.From the cccDNA pool supplement - cccDNA attenuation the balance of two aspects, to discuss the recent major developments in the development of DAAs.
